Q1

Option 1
- We don’t clearly address “why is a puppet the answer?”
- What was the moment you knew a puppet was the answer?
- “This felt perfect for TALISMAN, whose mission” -> “our mission”
- world–story needs an em-dash instead of en-dash


Option 2
- I like this one better
- Overall, feels long-winded, maybe too much on the star analogy, lots of rhetorical questions in the middle when talking about TALISMAN
- odd flow here “That's definition one. Not the disaster. Not the consequences.”

Q2

Option 1
- I like this answer being shorter, maybe move some of the TALISMAN description here from Q1-O2
- Sound extremely AI: “Honestly? It didn't reshape it. It revealed it.”

Option 2
- While very honest, I don’t know if it leads from a position of expertise and authority in the creative industry when speaking about reacting to industry changes + career pivot. In my experience, speaking about my pivot has undermined everything else I’ve said to industry experts
- BUT the cool story here is “also found myself in a backyard, putting my hands in soil”, so maybe that can be a pandemic-related anecdote without this reinvention narrative (because that might be one too many ideas here)

Q3

- Can move some context from Q1-O2 here, and shorted that response a bit too
- double space here “foreclosures.  Communities”
- Maybe my bias, I see compost as negative thing. If we’re hoping to sell creative services, this bit makes me think our ideas are not good: “Everything else in our creative process became compost.” Obviously not true and I get your point, but the non-creatives reading may not understand

Q4 
- I think we can be a little more specific here for short term. Could we speak about community activities and attendance? Student testimonials? Time spent in the spaces before/after? What happens from that first harvest of produce + the impact of produce in a food dessert?
- 2030 feels like medium term relative to 2026
- Otherwise this is solid, and concise

Q5
- Can we make an infographic for our 7 areas?
- Last 2 paragraphs have a bit awkward wording, we can tighten up the last 3 sentences

Q6
- “silo between” maybe should be “divide between”?
- What are “ESG reporting structures”?
- What if we started with SIF in this response -> 501c3?
- The response to “What kinds of brands would you love to work with?” is quite long and detailed across 4 paragraphs
