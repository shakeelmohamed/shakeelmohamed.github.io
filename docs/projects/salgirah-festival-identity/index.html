        <p>Salgirah is a religious festival observed by Ismaili Muslims every December. It marks the birthday of the late His Highness the Aga Khan IV, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad, the spiritual leader of 15 million Ismailis worldwide. December 13, 2021, marked his 85th birthday, or&nbsp;Salgirah.</p><br/>
        <p>With the Aga Khan IV’s passing in February 2025 his son, Aga Khan V has assumed the role as leader of the Ismaili Muslims. With it, a new identity system must be redeisnged.</p><br/>
        <p>The brief given to me by the Ismaili global communications team was to embrace the theme of shukr (gratitude in Arabic) while conveying 85 through (Islamic) geometry. This brand identity would be used worldwide by the Ismaili community to promote a sense of unity. The identity system was my first serious venture into Islamic design and the forms of Arabic typography. This area has become a great interest of mine since&nbsp;then.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This was by far the largest project I’ve worked on in terms of scale and one I will remember forever. The team only had two brief Zoom meetings over the six weeks of the project. I was impressed with our ability to collaborate across timezones through a Whatsapp group. Since this is a faith-based organization, all team members involved shared a common belief system about the&nbsp;festival.</p><br/>
        <p>One year later I was invited to refresh the identity for the Aga Khan IV’s 86th Salgirah festival. This became a flexible system to be used for the next two&nbsp;years.</p>

In the negative space between them, two additional rings are created for a total of five total rings of 17 (17x5 = 85). One diamond representing each year of the late His Highness’ life.</p>

            <p class="caption">Ultimately we realized the geometry of 86+ would be problematic, and chose to pivot and build the identity around 49 (as the Aga Khan is the 49th hereditary spiritual leader in this role). We settled on a new 7 ring motif (4 visible, 3 in negative space).</p>
