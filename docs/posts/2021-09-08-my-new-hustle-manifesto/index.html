                    <h1>My New Hustle Manifesto</h1>
                    <p>After a great deal of reflection during the pandemic, I‘ve begun to rethink how I want work.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="grid-column: 2 / 5;">
                    <div class="prose"><p>There’s no avoiding it, the pandemic has changed everything. Spending more time at home has forced me to pause, reflect, and turn inwards. Instead of spending 2-3 hours per day commuting and a few trips each year (physically hustling), I struggled to turn off the mental hustle for a long time. During this recent bout with burnout (which took a good 3 months to recover from) I knew something was seriously wrong and had to change for good.</p>
<h2>How did I get here?</h2>
<p>As someone who grew up struggling financially, when I saw a path towards financial stability I obsessed about reaching the proverbial finish line. Through college, I began working on my goals more intensely because I was seeing results for the first time in my life. I would work so hard that I began to expect burnout multiple times per year as the cost of success. I was hustling. After 11 years of going full throttle I’m realizing the consequences of the “hustle culture” I once idolized.</p>
<p>Music has always inspired me to keep going when I’m exhausted, it’s a shame that we’ve lost so many musicians to mental health issues over the years. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaQ2xkBadvc">behind the scenes video of the late Tim Bergling (aka Avicii) in the studio with Chris Martin</a>, the lead singer of Coldplay. Tim is receiving praise from one of the biggest musicians, yet he can’t see beyond making the track perfect. I saw the following comment and I nearly teared up, because I could see where my future could lead.</p>
<p><img src="./avicii-youtube-comment.png" alt="Screenshot of a YouTube comment saying &quot;#RIPAvicii so much work put into every single song. You should have rested sometimes. Should have taken care of your health.&quot;"></p>
<p>This moment resonated with me so deeply. For so long I’ve identified with making things better at all costs, including my own physical health. I had no problem pushing through mental health issues in the past, I would only stop working when my body gave out. For example, there were a few weeks in college when I was so wired from stress that I was sleeping only six nights a week. One day every week I wouldn’t sleep the entire night or day because I refused to rest. Needless to say I’ve experienced some scary symptoms of sleep deprivation including dissociation and hallucinations, I do not recommend it.</p>
<h2>Hustle as I knew it</h2>
<p>After settling into corporate life for a few years, I forced myself to hustle harder. I was less social around the office, worked later, took less breaks, and starved myself at times – all in the name of working harder. Instead of enjoying accomplishments throughout my career, I began to feel worse after achieving a goal than I did while working on it. After a promotion or completing a project, I would slow down for about 2 hours before anxiety about the next thing kicked in. I did everything by brute force, if I couldn’t figure something out I’d spend more time and effort instead of working smarter.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, accomplishments do not motivate me. What keeps me going these days is the experience of flow, getting totally lost in a project while time flies by. I worked super hard, sacrificed everything including my health, and didn’t even enjoy the accomplishments? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X-ixRXnRMU">Wait a damn minute…</a></p>
<p>For over a decade, hustle was my life. Now it’s time for something new.</p>
<h2>My New Hustle Manifesto ™️</h2>
<p>Anyone who’s familiar with Agile or Scrum likely knows about the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. It’s a set of principles which establish the Agile philosophy. In my search to reframe what hustle means to me, I’ve put together a few ideas which I’m calling <em>My New Hustle Manifesto</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep work over being busy</strong> – it doesn’t matter how much I’m getting done in a day if I’m doing things that aren’t important to me. Direction is more important than speed.</li>
<li><strong>Setting boundaries over feeling guilty</strong> – I’m not helpful to anyone if I’m overcommitted and stressed out. Set boundaries on response times, working hours, and timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Taking breaks over burnout</strong> – working sustainably is essential, there’s always going to be something demanding my attention. Be physically and mentally ready for anything by prioritizing rest.</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness over stress</strong> – even in the most stressful situations, it’s better to have a clear head to make sound decisions. I could be more miserable doing something else. Stay grounded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It’s an adjustment</h2>
<p>Changing the way I approach work is not going to happen overnight, it will require constant reminders and catching myself when I drift into my old patterns. That’s what growth is all about. I won’t dive into the details of the Eisenhower Matrix here, <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix">Todoist has written a great post about it</a>. It’s a great tool for auditing which activities you devote your time to. In the old hustle mode, it’s easy to get caught up in in being busy – doing urgent things of varying importance. The key to this new definition of hustle is to consistently make time for the important things, which aren’t necessarily urgent.</p>

<p>This post was inspired by the phenomenal book <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport. I recommend reading the second part in the book which is focused on practical strategies to prioritize periods of intense concentration. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Asian Efficiency, a group I’ve been following for over a decade for productivity tips for all areas of life.</p>
