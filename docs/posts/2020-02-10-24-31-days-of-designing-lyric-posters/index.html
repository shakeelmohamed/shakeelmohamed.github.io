                    <h1>24/31 Days of Designing Lyric Posters</h1>
                    <p class="bold">For the month of January, I challenged myself to level up my typography and overall graphic design skills by designing a poster every day.</p><br>
                    <div class="prose"><p>For the month of January, I challenged myself to level up my typography and overall graphic design skills by designing a poster every day.</p>
<p>Of the 31 days in January, I ended up designing 24 daily posters - this was a huge win for me in terms of going through design process and sharing my results on Instagram every day. Yup, I missed 7 days total and I have <strong>no regrets</strong>. Life got crazy, and I’m learning to love myself enough to not stress over perfection. I decided to have each poster represent song lyrics that have really impacted me from my favorite artists: <strong>24 unique artists for 24 days</strong>.</p>
<p>One year ago (January 2019) I designed my first poster which… was kind of a disaster, you’ll see it in the first image below. 😅 I used a very strange typeface, the kerning (letter spacing) is all crazy, and there’s no sense of hierarchy. After soaking up all the amazing content from Chris Do from The Futur (both free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks">YouTube</a> content and the <a href="https://academy.thefutur.com/p/typography-01">Typography course</a>), I recognized learned what I was missing back then. <strong>I saw the light</strong>. So I knew I needed to put some of this into practice, and this daily poster design challenge was born. What better place to start than to redesign that first poster, so I did just that.</p>
<p>These posters aren’t perfect, some of them were downright bad. But I’ve expanded my creativity under time constraints, which is an invaluable lesson for my design journey.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve included 4 of my favorite posters below</strong>, feel free to check out the others on my company’s Instagram account: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ntrsct.designs/">@ntrsct.designs</a>. I still have a lot to learn, but I’ve fallen even more in love with the design process during this journey. Looking forward to writing a future post about a daily logo design challenge at some point!</p>
<p>As a preview, I’ve included a list of all 24 songs, artists and the lyrics I used for the posters. In order, the list of all songs &amp; lyrics I used for the posters. Reading just the lyrics in order tells an interesting story 🤔</p>
