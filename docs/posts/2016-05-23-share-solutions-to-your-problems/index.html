                    <h1>Share Solutions to Your Problems</h1>
                    <p class="bold">If you have a problem, chances are somebody else has that problem. When you share your experience, you’ve made it that much easier for the next person to find a solution.</p><br>
                    <div class="prose"><p>As a programmer, it can be really hard to do some things that seem incredibly simple. One example from my <a href="../2015-03-19-hackers-first-logo-designing-in-powerpoint">senior project</a> was trying to find an AngularJS module to find the latitude/longitude of a street address (geocoding). I spent half a day Googling, and trying out many potential solutions before I finally hacked together something that worked. This is a really painful process, and I seem to encounter this several times every year… probably once per month actually.</p>
<p>Once I had a working solution I did the next logical thing, make an example and share with the world! (Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/angular-geocoding-demo">GitHub</a>.) Maybe nobody will ever use the code, or even see it — but that doesn’t matter. What really matters is that I’ll already have a working solution if I need to accomplish this task again. More importantly though, I’ve exercised the “deep thinking” part of my brain; the next time I face any problem I’ll be more equipped to analyze it and determine a solution in less time.</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back here, and look at this from a higher level. Here’s what happened:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>I had a problem.</li>
<li>I looked for a solution, and didn’t really find one.</li>
<li>I struggled for significantly longer than I needed to.</li>
<li>I finally found a solution.</li>
<li>I was so relieved to find this solution that I isolated it (built it) and shared it with the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon further reflection, this is essentially how some of the most popular open source projects were created! (Linux, Git, Django, WordPress, and Oh-my-zsh come to mind).</p>
<hr>
<p>If you can’t explain what you did and why, you’ll only set yourself up for a bigger headache later when (not if) you encounter a bug related to the hack(s). I suppose you can learn by hacking blindly… (We all started there, right?) But, knowing how and why your code works will make you a better programmer in the long run.</p>
<p>In a broader context, creating and documenting solutions for your problems seems like a great way to really understand them. This doesn’t need to be limited to programming, startups, fitness, or filing your taxes. If you have a problem, chances are somebody else has that problem. When you share your experience, you’ve made it that much easier for the next person to find a solution.</p>
