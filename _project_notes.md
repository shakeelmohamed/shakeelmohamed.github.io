## Rothko Documentary Campaign

<!-- NOTE: On May 23, 2023 I accidentally lost all the content for this project... hopefully Cargo can roll it back otherwise I will be re-writing it. -->

<br>
Wordmark and posters for a campaign promoting a documentary about Mark Rothko, the abstract expressionist.<br>

<br>
We selected an episode of the PBS documentary series American Masters, and the individual featured as our subject.<br>

<br>
Design concept: in memoriam.<br>

<br>
Depth of research and critique helped me to clarify the forms and vocabulary used throughout the project. Once I let go of initial logo concepts focused on the negative aspect of Rothko’s life, I landed on a dynamic system.<br>

<br>
In my solution, “Mark” can be placed in numerous positions around “Rothko”, symbolizing the artist’s search among many styles of art. Big thanks to Erin Georgia&nbsp; for this idea during midterm guest critique!<br>

<br>
The posters came together at the last minute once I embraced placing elements over Rothko’s artwork. This project taught me to design outside of my comfort zone and take risks once in a while.<br>

<br>
During a break in our final presentation, I pulled together a rough augmented reality experience with Adobe Aero.<br><br>
<b>Future work:</b> I plan to expand this project further by envisioning a pop-up exhibition to promote the documentary episode. This exibition would be focused on his life, rather than his art, giving the audience an opporuntity to lean more about the artist through an immersive experience.<br><br>
<b>Special thanks to:</b> The National Gallery of Art for high quality images of Rothko’s artwork. I am also grateful to Sean Adams, Michael Neal, Erin Georgia, and Sean Shang for additional critique during the semester.</div>

<b>Subject:</b> Mark Rothko, abstract expressionist painter<br>
<b>Goal:</b> Design a book to accompany the documentary campaign demonstrated in<a href="Mark-Rothko-Documentary-Campaign" rel="history"> the previous project</a>.<br>
<b>Title:</b> Mark Rothko: Art for Mystics.<br>
<b>Cover:</b> Stark off-white, reminiscent of mass market religious texts. People often feel unexpected emotions in front of Rothko paintings. To me, these are mystical experiences.<br>
<b>Typeface:</b> Neue Haas Grotesk was chosen to embody the crystal goblet concept, letting the content speak for itself.<br>

<br>
Colors were inspired by the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. The non-denominational Chapel was one of Rothko’s final projects which he never saw completed.<br>

<br>
Intro/outro: A few spreads guide the reader from from the everyday material world to that of the mystical, symbolized by a slow gray to purple gradient. The outro follows the sequence in reverse. This concept is based on an engawa, a Japanese architecture element to bridge the outside world to the home.<br><br>
Each chapter begins with a full spread. The chapter title is large, paired with a relevant Rothko quote on the opposite page.<br>

<br>
<ol><li><b>Preface</b> — an introduction to Mark Rothko.<br></li><li><b>
Search</b> — early explorations through lesser known styles of art.<br></li><li><b>
Voice</b> — a photo essay of his best known abstract works.<br></li><li><b>
Wisdom</b> — his advice for new artists.<br></li><li><b>
Legacy</b> — an interview with Christopher Rothko, his son, which informed my overall design direction.<br></li><li><b>
Reflection</b> — my brief and emotional editorial capturing my thoughts as I completed the book.<br></li></ol>

<br>
In the end, I found my 74 page book was not enough to convey the impact of one person’s life. Let alone a 500 page book.

<br>

<br>
Special thanks to the National Gallery of Art for providing high quality images of Rothko’s artwork, and to Architectural Digest for a beautiful photo of the Rothko Chapel.

TYPO is a fictional typography conference identity design project.<br>
<br>We were tasked with selecting a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designing a wordmark, 3' x 6' feet posters (huge), t-shirts, name badges… oh and we were restricted to black and white!<br><br>
I also designed: stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.<br>

<br>
Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms&nbsp; to symbolize these concepts.<br><br>
The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo (@eneltamayo), has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community by contrast.<br><br>
I envision conference organizers and staff wearing black shirts to not draw attention to themselves backstage. Attendees would receive white shirts when checking in on the first day of the conference. <br>

<br>
After my initial portfolio review at the 2021 AIGA Portfolio Festival, I recognized the need to improve my work to align with my career aspirations. One year later, at the 2022 Festival, I shared my growth journey, which ultimately led to my acceptance into ArtCenter's Graphic Design MFA program.<br>
<br>
Months later, at the 2022 AIGA National Design Conference in Seattle, I had the pleasure of meeting Louise and Ace, another designer whose work she reviewed during the Festival.<br><br>

Unfortunately I was not able to attend for multiple reasons, but received some photos from the local team. Additional highlights are shown below. All assets designed by the local team.

Above is the recording of my presentation of this project (at 6:15) from the 2022 AIGA Portfolio Festival.<br><br>
{image 2}<br>Full-color logo. The colors come from the Ismaili community’s flag, seen in the photograph of His Highness the Aga Khan (below).
<br><br>
{image 3}<br>Here, His Highness the Aga Khan is pictured in front of the Canadian and Ismaili flags at the Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa, Canada.
<br><br>
{image 4}<br>Five Ring Motif. The motif is my take on Islamic geometric design. Initially, you see three rings of 17 diamonds. In the negative space between them, two additional rings are created for a total of five total rings of 17 (17x5 = 85). One diamond representing each year of His Highness’ life.<br>
{image 5}<br>The three rings are inspired by the three nuktas (dots) above the first letter in the Arabic word, shukr, meaning gratitude. The rings in negative space are a reminder of the esoteric aspects of the Ismaili faith.<br>
{image 6}<br>Additional logo variations. The system works in full color on white backgrounds, or in white on red or green backgrounds.
<br><br>
{image 7}<br>Brand pattern. Designed by deconstructing the motif to an individual diamond and tiling them infinitely. These forms create an interesting 2.5D illusion.
<br><br><br>
<h2>The following assets were created by marketing teams in various countries after delivering the completed brand package.</h2><br>
{image 8}<br>After delivering all brand assets, social media teams in the Ismaili community launched global, national, and regional digital marketing campaigns. These assets (social media content, videos, website) were created by many talented people around the world in multiple languages. I have included them here to show the context and impact of the brand identity.<br>

<b>Organization:</b> <a href="https://the.ismaili/" target="_blank">The Ismaili Community</a> (globally)<br>
<b>Media:</b> Branding, Motion<br>
<b>Tools:</b> Illustrator, Photoshop, AfterEffects, InDesign<br><br><b>Goal:</b> Design a unified festival identity for the global Ismaili Muslim community in 21 countries.<br><br>
Salgirah is a religious festival observed by Ismaili Muslims every December. It marks the birthday of His Highness the Aga Khan, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad, the spiritual leader of 15 million Ismailis worldwide. December 13, 2021, marked his 85th birthday, or Salgirah.<br><br>The brief given to me by the Ismaili global communications team was to embrace the theme of shukr (gratitude in Arabic) while conveying 85 through (Islamic) geometry. This brand identity would be used worldwide by the Ismaili community to promote a sense of unity.
<br>
<br>This was by far the largest project I’ve worked on in terms of scale and one I will remember forever. The team only had two brief Zoom meetings over the six weeks of the project. I was impressed with our ability to collaborate across timezones through a Whatsapp group. Since this is a faith-based organization, all team members involved shared a common belief system about the festival.<br><br>
 
One year later I was invited to refresh the indentity for the Aga Khan’s 86th Salgirah festival.</div>
