<b>When:</b> 2023<br>
<b>Media:&nbsp;</b>transmedia, coding, installation<br>
<b>Tools:</b> TouchDesigner, Python, projection mapping, model building, microphone<br><br>
<b>Goal:</b> design an installation to reflect on daily life.<br><br>This interactive installation uses projection mapping to visually show the impact of our voice through generative graphics activated by microphone input. Applying graphic design foundations across media types has always interested me, this was the perfect opportunity to explore design in space.<br>
<br>
I was inspired by Masuru Emoto’s research on what happens to water crystals based on what words or music they are exposed to before freezing. I watched his documentary as a child and totally forgotten about it until one day I remembered this reference.<br>
<br>
This project is not done, but I am really pleased with my progress and hope to continue exploring these technologies. Transmedia curriculum is one of the main reasons I chose to attend ArtCenter, and I’m so glad to learn these skills I’ve been thinking about for years!<br>
<br>
<b>Future work:</b> adding key phrase triggers and emotion detection software to provide a significantly more engaging experience.

This refined symbol is a reminder of the groundbreaking work they do.<br><br>{image 9}<br>Audit of current brand assets. Through my interviews, I was surprised how many users of Midjourney knew little to nothing about the brand, many had no idea their logo was a sailboat. Though I explored many forms, with Gerardo’s guidance I chose a brand evolution rather than revolution and continued the nautical theme based on interviews with the Founder, David Holz.
<br>
<br>{image 10}<br>There was little information about Midjourney existing brand given how new the company is. My research focused on Founder interviews to get a clear understanding of his mission.<br>
<br>
{image 12}<br>The Sail. After an exhaustive exploration of logo designs, I found a beautiful compromise of abstraction while carrying forward the DNA of their existing logo. The sail is the simplest expression of the sailboat, which connects back to the above quote from David Holz.
<br><br>
{image 13}<br>The brand colors emerged from light refraction, symbolizing expansive creativity possible with their products.
<br><br>
{image 14}<br>These colors aim to connect with a broader audience across cultures, ages, and industries. The primary color palette helps Midjourney stand out from the majority of tech companies.<br><br>

<br><br>
{image 19}<br>
Though Midjourney has been a remote company, I wanted to imagine what their first HQ office space might look like. The HQ would feature a brushed stainless steel sculpture of the Midjourney sail outside.<br>
<br>{image 20}<br>I also envisioned Midjourney launching a users conference called Midjourney Navigate, to be held in San Francisco.
<br><br>
{image 21}<br>Keynote stage and various conference merch. At Navigate, Midjourney would announce their new digital platform featuring an iOS app and image generation in browser (evolving from the Discord only experience).
<br>
<br>
{image 5}<br>Promotional posters in context.
<br>
<br>
{image 23}<br>Notable creative leaders would receive VIP invites to the conference, including customized VIP cards, access to 1:1 consultations with AI experts, and an invite to a celebration evening.
<br><br>
{image 24}<br>Midjourney VIP access cards would have digital integration and provide access to VIP lounge areas at the venues.
<br><br>
{image 25}<br>I also explored what form an interactive installation might look like at the conference. Attendees would be able to speak into microphones placed around the installation to generate images from their voice.<br><br>

I re-imagined the identity of Midjourney across a wide range of touchpoints including digital, print, conference, wayfinding, a new corporate headquarters, and much more.<br><br>
<b>“How do you build these boats that let them navigate and be empowered and sort of sail the ocean of imagination, instead of just drowning?”. 

<br>
(Founder, David Holz).</b><br>
<br>
The new Midjourney logo is an evolution of the previous sailboat symbol. This refined symbol is a reminder of the groundbreaking work they do within generative AI.<br>
<br>
The new brand colors are inspired by light refraction, symbolizing the expansive creativity possible with our products. These colors aim to connect with a broader audience across cultures, and industries.<br><br>
The underlying strategy is rooted in remaining competitive with the many new generative AI companies emerging since 2021.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Special thanks to:</b> Gerardo Herrera and Miles Mazzie.<br>

I began designing the Arabic character set which has a different set of complexities. In this first draft I remained rigid to the same grid as the Latin character set (7x7 without letter-spacing since Arabic is a connected script). In doing so, I found some forms do not reduce down as nicely as I would like. The next revision I will try is on a 14x14 grid, subdividing the current grid in half.</div>

## Rothko Documentary Campaign

A poster series promoting the documentary episode.<br>
<br><br>
{image 2}<br>
Sean Adams, the Department Chair of Graphic Design at ArtCenter, selected one poster from the set to display in his office.<br><br><br>
<br>{image 7}<br>
The final wordmark set on a purple inspired by the colors of Rothko’s paintings in the Rothko Chapel. The primitive forms for “Mark” tie back to the primitive emotions evoked by his work. While “Rothko” is set in all caps to symbolize the monolithic scale of his paintings.<br><br>
<br>
<br>
{image 8}<br>During our midterm critique with some recent alumni, Erin Son suggested looking at the placement of “Mark” as a dynamic element which could create a logo system. Conceptually, this connects back to Mark Rothko’s many years of searching before finally settling on the style of art we know him for (and his legacy) as Rothko.<br>
<br>{image 12}<br>Extending the identity to a booklet required a special consideration for messaging. I chose the title “Art for Mystics”, based on the following definition for mystical: inspiring a sense of spiritual mystery, awe, and fascination. This sense of awe is due partly to the scale of Rothko’s paintings.<br><br>    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgb(119, 119, 119); aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; width: 100%;" src="https://indd.adobe.com/embed/0ce1fbfe-ae15-462d-b89c-fc8d21c9b685?startpage=1&amp;allowFullscreen=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>The complete book is available for viewing above.<br>

{image 17}<br>Intro/outro: A few spreads guide the reader from from the everyday material world to that of the mystical, symbolized by a slow gray to purple gradient.

<br><br>
{image 4}<br>During my research I visited MOCA in Downtown Los Angeles for another Rothko experience.<br><br>
{image 5}<br>My research included reading Johanna Drucker’s recently released book, <i>Inventing the Alphabet</i>, as I saught a deeper understanding for primitive letterforms. Conceptually, this aligned with Rothko’s ability to tap into the viewer’s primitive emotions with his artwork.<br>

<b>Recognition:</b> One poster was selected for display in office of the Chair of Graphic Design at ArtCenter.<br>

<br>
Wordmark and posters for a campaign promoting a documentary about Mark Rothko, the abstract expressionist.<br>

<br>
We selected an episode of the PBS documentary series American Masters, and the individual featured as our subject.<br>

<br>
Design concept: in memoriam.<br>

<br>
Depth of research and critique helped me to clarify the forms and vocabulary used throughout the project. Once I let go of initial logo concepts focused on the negative aspect of Rothko’s life, I landed on a dynamic system.<br>

<br>
In my solution, “Mark” can be placed in numerous positions around “Rothko”, symbolizing the artist’s search among many styles of art. Big thanks to Erin Son for this idea during midterm guest critique!<br><br>
As for the book, colors were inspired by the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. The non-denominational Chapel was one of Rothko’s final projects which he never saw completed before his passing.<br>

<b>Typefaces:</b>&nbsp;Yink from Eclectotype and Ofelia from Blackletra.<br>

<br>
TYPO is a fictional typography conference identity design project.<br>
<br>We were tasked with selecting a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designing a wordmark, 3' x 6' feet posters (huge), t-shirts, name badges… oh and we were restricted to black and white!<br><br>
I also designed: stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.<br>

<br>
Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms&nbsp; to symbolize these concepts.<br><br>
The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community by contrast.<br><br>
I envision conference organizers and staff wearing black shirts to not draw attention to themselves backstage. Attendees would receive white shirts when checking in on the first day of the conference. <br>

Above is the recording of my presentation of this project (at 6:15) from the 2022 AIGA Portfolio Festival.<br><br>

<br><br>
{image 4}<br>Five Ring Motif. The motif is my take on Islamic geometric design. Initially, you see three rings of 17 diamonds. In the negative space between them, two additional rings are created for a total of five total rings of 17 (17x5 = 85). One diamond representing each year of His Highness’ life.<br>

Initially, you see three rings of 17 diamonds. In the negative space between them, two additional rings are created for a total of five total rings of 17 (17x5 = 85). One diamond representing each year of His Highness’ life.<br>
{image 5}<br>The three rings are inspired by the three nuktas (dots) above the first letter in the Arabic word, shukr, meaning gratitude. The rings in negative space are a reminder of the esoteric aspects of the Ismaili faith.<br>
{image 6}<br>Additional logo variations. The system works in full color on white backgrounds, or in white on red or green backgrounds.
<br><br>
{image 7}<br>Brand pattern. Designed by deconstructing the motif to an individual diamond and tiling them infinitely. These forms create an interesting 2.5D illusion.<br>
<br>{image 19}<br>The geometry of 86 didn’t resolve so nicely as 85. The following year I got a call after the global team realized they couldn’t simply “add another diamond” for that year’s identity.<br><br>
{image 20}<br>Ultimately we realized the geometry of 86+ would be problematic, and chose to pivot and build the identity around 49 (as the Aga Khan is the 49th hereditary spiritual leader in this role). We settled on a new 7 ring motif (4 visible, 3 in negative space).
<br>
{image 21}<br>Secondary lockups for years 86-89. I wanted these elements to live separately from the primary 7 ring motif as these next 4 years were “non-milestone” years. I look forward to revisiting this identity for a refresh for the Aga Khan’s 90th Salgirah!<br><br>
{image 22}<br>
<br>
{image 8}<br>After delivering all brand assets, social media teams in the Ismaili community launched global, national, and regional digital marketing campaigns. These assets (social media content, videos, website) were created by many talented people around the world in multiple languages. I have included them here to show the context and impact of the brand identity.<br>

{image 23}<br>The local team in Seattle told me about their ambitious design plans for the celebration, and that I had to be there to see my design come to life at the venue. Returning to Seattle the weekend before finals in my first term... we had a lovely hometown celebration with cultural dance performances, dinner, and a live band.<br>
<br>

{image 24}<br>Despite my intense workload for the last few days of the semester, I made a last-minute decision to take a 36-hour trip back home in secrecy. It was the first time I could physically see anything I’d designed at this scale. In my hometown no less.<br><br>

Salgirah is a religious festival observed by Ismaili Muslims every December. It marks the birthday of His Highness the Aga Khan, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad, the spiritual leader of 15 million Ismailis worldwide. December 13, 2021, marked his 85th birthday, or Salgirah.<br><br>The brief given to me by the Ismaili global communications team was to embrace the theme of shukr (gratitude in Arabic) while conveying 85 through (Islamic) geometry. This brand identity would be used worldwide by the Ismaili community to promote a sense of unity.
<br>
<br>This was by far the largest project I’ve worked on in terms of scale and one I will remember forever. The team only had two brief Zoom meetings over the six weeks of the project. I was impressed with our ability to collaborate across timezones through a Whatsapp group. Since this is a faith-based organization, all team members involved shared a common belief system about the festival.<br><br>
 
One year later I was invited to refresh the identity for the Aga Khan’s 86th Salgirah festival. This became a flexible system to be used for the next three years.<br><br>
<b>Special thanks to:</b> the dozens of volunteers who applied the identity system across many media types around the world.</div>

<b>Tools:</b> Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign<br><br><b>Goal:</b> Quickly adapt my identity design from the previous year without disrupting the established geometry.<br><br>Salgirah is a religious festival observed by Ismaili Muslims every December. It marks the birthday of His Highness the Aga Khan, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad, the spiritual leader of 15 million Ismailis worldwide. December 13, 2022, marked his 86th birthday, or Salgirah. For additional context, please read through <b><a href="Salgirah85-International-Festival-Branding" rel="history">the identity I designed from the previous year</a></b>.<br><br>
The main challenge in designing this year’s identity was finding a way to represent the number 86 with geometry in the logo. From the previous year, 85 had easy multiples to work with (7 x 15) however 86 could only be broken down to 43 x 2 which does not lead to a pleasing form.<br><br>
After discussions with international marketing leadership, I was given permission to explore the number 49 instead. His Highness the Aga Khan is recognized as the the 49th Ismaili Muslim Imam and a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. 49 breaks down nicely into 7x7 and offered the opportunity to reuse the identity for future years.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">The local team in Seattle told me about their ambitious design plans for the celebration, and that I had to be there to see my design come to life at the venue.

Hadhan Coffee Roasting Co. is a captivating hypothetical brand that takes you on a sensory journey with every sip. The name comes from the Arabic word for “hug”, symbolizing the feeling of comfort from a warm cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
Targeting the diverse city of Toronto, Hadhan's specialty beans are sourced from countries with significant importance in the Islamic history. The brand's unique varietals are packaged in bags that showcase distinctive Islamic patterns from the beans' country of origin or roast.<br>
<br>
During my research, I discovered a connection between the origins of coffee and Islamic countries, which added a layer of storytelling to the project. While coffee beans originated in Ethiopia, it was the mystics in Yemen who first recognized and consumed them for their energizing properties. This project expanded beyond just packaging and transformed into a brand that shares the untold and fascinating history of coffee from Islamic countries.<br><br>
Through expert interviews, I received invaluable feedback from subject matter experts in packaging design, history of coffee in Islamic countries, and native<br><br>
Ongoing revisions:<br>
<ul><li>Hand lettering for primary logotype</li><li>Revised brand story</li><li>Expanded brand applications (posters, t-shirts, coffee mugs)</li></ul><br>

<b>When:</b> 2024 (in progress)<br>
<b>Media:</b> posters, messaging, spatial, 3D modeling<br>
<b>Tools:</b> InDesign, Illustrator, p5.js, AfterEffects, Blender, Midjourney, Photoshop<br><br><b>Goal:</b> reinterpret the message of a non-profit organization through the perspective of a lifestyle brand for a new audience.<br><br>
<b>Recognition:</b> ArtCenter Student Gallery,&nbsp;Hoffmitz Milken Center for Typography (HMCT) Billboards<br><br>Tasked with imagining a collaboration between a lifestyle brand and non-profit organization, I chose Malala Fund and Timex. Malala Fund is an advocacy non-profit for girls’ education in middle-income and low-income counties (which they prefer to use instead of “third-world”) founded by Malala Yousafzai. Timex is one of the most ubiquitous watch brands. Together, this exhibition is targeting young professionals in SoCal with a key unifying factor of empowerment and time.<br><br>
I chose to use Midjourney generated images to demonstrate how as visual communicators we can convey a message without putting someone in harm’s way. In particular,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl" target="_blank">Sharbat Gula</a> (the “Afghan Girl” from National Geographic) was put in danger after her photograph became so broadly known.<br><br>A key finding emerged through research: both organizations are united by the idea of 12.<br>– Malala Fund: “Twelve years of education”<br>– Timex: 12 hours per AM and PM<br>
<br>
Though very much in progress, this notion of 12 will inform the rest of the physical exhibition layout and perhaps two more posters.<br><br>
<b>Future work includes:&nbsp;</b><br>
– Improved content sequence and environmental design in the exhibit<br>
– Placing the exhibit in space, I am considering venues around Washington D.C.<br>
– A polished fly through video, there are several rough points<br>
– More complete generative design integrations, and standalone gendesign experiences<br>
– Custom watch dial design, I already have a base 3D model to work from. This 3D model can then be placed at the perimeter of the exhibit<br><br><b>Special thanks to:</b> Tyrone Drake.<br>
