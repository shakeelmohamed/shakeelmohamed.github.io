<!-- NOTE: On May 23, 2023 I accidentally lost all the content for this project... hopefully Cargo can roll it back otherwise I will be re-writing it. -->

<br>
Wordmark and posters for a campaign promoting a documentary about Mark Rothko, the abstract expressionist.<br>

<br>
We selected an episode of the PBS documentary series American Masters, and the individual featured as our subject.<br>

<br>
Design concept: in memoriam.<br>

<br>
Depth of research and critique helped me to clarify the forms and vocabulary used throughout the project. Once I let go of initial logo concepts focused on the negative aspect of Rothko’s life, I landed on a dynamic system.<br>

<br>
In my solution, “Mark” can be placed in numerous positions around “Rothko”, symbolizing the artist’s search among many styles of art. Big thanks to Erin Georgia&nbsp; for this idea during midterm guest critique!<br>

<br>
The posters came together at the last minute once I embraced placing elements over Rothko’s artwork. This project taught me to design outside of my comfort zone and take risks once in a while.<br>

<br>
During a break in our final presentation, I pulled together a rough augmented reality experience with Adobe Aero.<br><br>
<b>Future work:</b> I plan to expand this project further by envisioning a pop-up exhibition to promote the documentary episode. This exibition would be focused on his life, rather than his art, giving the audience an opporuntity to lean more about the artist through an immersive experience.<br><br>
<b>Special thanks to:</b> The National Gallery of Art for high quality images of Rothko’s artwork. I am also grateful to Sean Adams, Michael Neal, Erin Georgia, and Sean Shang for additional critique during the semester.</div>

<b>Media:</b> branding, editorial, book<br>
<b>Tools:</b> InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator<br><br>
<b>Subject:</b> Mark Rothko, abstract expressionist painter<br>
<b>Goal:</b> Design a book to accompany the documentary campaign demonstrated in<a href="Mark-Rothko-Documentary-Campaign" rel="history"> the previous project</a>.<br>
<b>Title:</b> Mark Rothko: Art for Mystics.<br>
<b>Cover:</b> Stark off-white, reminiscent of mass market religious texts. People often feel unexpected emotions in front of Rothko paintings. To me, these are mystical experiences.<br>
<b>Typeface:</b> Neue Haas Grotesk was chosen to embody the crystal goblet concept, letting the content speak for itself.<br>

<br>
Colors were inspired by the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. The non-denominational Chapel was one of Rothko’s final projects which he never saw completed.<br>

<br>
Intro/outro: A few spreads guide the reader from from the everyday material world to that of the mystical, symbolized by a slow gray to purple gradient. The outro follows the sequence in reverse. This concept is based on an engawa, a Japanese architecture element to bridge the outside world to the home.<br><br>
Each chapter begins with a full spread. The chapter title is large, paired with a relevant Rothko quote on the opposite page.<br>

<br>
<ol><li><b>Preface</b> — an introduction to Mark Rothko.<br></li><li><b>
Search</b> — early explorations through lesser known styles of art.<br></li><li><b>
Voice</b> — a photo essay of his best known abstract works.<br></li><li><b>
Wisdom</b> — his advice for new artists.<br></li><li><b>
Legacy</b> — an interview with Christopher Rothko, his son, which informed my overall design direction.<br></li><li><b>
Reflection</b> — my brief and emotional editorial capturing my thoughts as I completed the book.<br></li></ol>

<br>
In the end, I found my 74 page book was not enough to convey the impact of one person’s life. Let alone a 500 page book.

<br>

<br>
Special thanks to the National Gallery of Art for providing high quality images of Rothko’s artwork, and to Architectural Digest for a beautiful photo of the Rothko Chapel.

TYPO is a fictional typography conference identity design project.<br>
<br>We were tasked with selecting a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designing a wordmark, 3' x 6' feet posters (huge), t-shirts, name badges… oh and we were restricted to black and white!<br><br>
I also designed: stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.<br>

<br>
Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms&nbsp; to symbolize these concepts.<br><br>
The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo (@eneltamayo), has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community by contrast.<br><br>
I envision conference organizers and staff wearing black shirts to not draw attention to themselves backstage. Attendees would receive white shirts when checking in on the first day of the conference. <br>

<br><b>Recognition:</b> I presented my portfolio live to all Festival attendees over Zoom, where I received valuable feedback from Louise Sandhaus.<br>
<br>
After my initial portfolio review at the 2021 AIGA Portfolio Festival, I recognized the need to improve my work to align with my career aspirations. One year later, at the 2022 Festival, I shared my growth journey, which ultimately led to my acceptance into ArtCenter's Graphic Design MFA program.<br>
<br>
Months later, at the 2022 AIGA National Design Conference in Seattle, I had the pleasure of meeting Louise and Ace, another designer whose work she reviewed during the Festival.<br><br>
