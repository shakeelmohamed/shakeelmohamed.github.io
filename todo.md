# TODO

For conversion from mp4 to avif (eventually, phase out all gifs):
```shell
ffmpeg -i ontology_cover.mp4 -c:v libaom-av1 -crf 20 -b:v 0 -still-picture 0 ontology_cover.avif
```

Figure out how to CLI automate spell check like this app: https://www.spl.ing/report-card?website=shakeelmohamed.com&uuid=e4e2c283-6e32-4327-97f6-955a0a38ef2d
- Need a custom dictionary for cspell: https://cspell.org/docs/dictionaries#dictionary-definition

Good reference for pug x 11ty:

## ASAP

- [ ] update skills on resume PDF: Google Analytics, Notion, Affinity, Grasshopper (and match order)
- [ ] Add AIGA talk link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PPGcU47IWs
- [ ] Fix right margin issues on tablet / half-width desktop size
- [ ] Lots of strange layout issues on mobile
- [ ] move all logo family / kit of parts stuff to the bottom of each project (before process)
- [ ] MJ: brand guidelines
- [ ] MJ: brand inspiration book (better name)
- [ ] secret/hidden landing pages for video editing, tech, etc.

## Bio revision

- [ ] TPS: wristband motion... there is not face between inside/outside oops! Also make it loop perfectly
- [ ] TPS: show motion design system (3x vertical social posts, LT, slates/bumpers) - show the system/grid, adaptive resizing
- [ ] check OG images for projects, then posts, etc. Consider gif/video versions
- [ ] Experience... consider Parenthetical titles or in 1 line summary at the top: Product Manager (Functionally leading roadmap without formal title)
- [ ] Future bio update: I’m interested in environmental design, creative technology, and Arabic type design.
- [ ] Can set up thesis in my bio a bit to speak more maturely as being an advocate and helping others to become advocates.
- [ ] Need a new tagline! 3 key ideas: advocate/community for designers, cross-disciplinary approach, and typography is central to everything I do.
- [ ] ...(longer form about me could build) ... this began in my past career as a software engineer where I built my analytical thinking skills, while understanding the need for clearer communication about the technologies I was building...
- [ ] Overall positioning through leadership, technical expertise, and economy design


- Thesis:
- [ ] social media, re-do it
- [ ] the quiz!
- [ ] process book
- [ ] other sketches, ideation from fall

Others
- [ ] CTA on homepage: desktop 2rem on 3rem lead, TBD mobile
- [ ] CTA footer on all pages?
- [ ] Make an overview gif for each project cover (still fallback to still for OG)
- [ ] Can make a clearer
- [ ] Make a separate landing page for freelance/contract work, e.g.: /services or something
    - [ ]  copy on this page should be something like "clarify brand, build trust" - basically speaking to the outcomes and results of design
- [ ] Slideshows need arrow icons to be visible that there is more there (vs. looking like a gif)
    - [ ] MJ is not optimized for skimming, missing all the good stuff with the slideshows
- [ ] referential mono: crit/printed process, kashida/Eid motion, what about the posters?
- [ ] RM: show research kufic chart also
- [ ]   show stickers from grad show
- [ ]   motion, like Kashida, etc.
- [ ]   brand guidelines document (MJ) - great 1920x1080 mockup, just need to design the images now
- [ ]   website (Thesis, TPS, MJ)
- [ ]   MJ motion (logo reveal, 15-30s piece, product UI features)
- [ ]   fix composition for "Ontology - 15.png", the leading is not right
- [ ] Rough out some UI/web case study (maybe Digital Anarchy)
- [ ] TPS: use this for website particle physics (better than three.js): https://github.com/naughtyduk/particlesGL
- [ ] Think about cursor or other interaction/motion points using the icon logo
- [ ] accessibility check, definitely needs help: https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=shakeelmohamed.com&flag=ww#

## P1

- [ ] MJ: why am I not showing the brand guidelines? NEED THIS in a slide overview off-axis angle format
- [ ] MJ: motion
- [ ] MJ: update project summary
- [ ] MJ: spend 3 hours on motion (new storyboard, logo decomposition into layers, production), goal should be 10 seconds max
- [ ] Thesis: what are the points of my talk? some high level ideas, or takeaways... still unclear what I am bringing to expand the perceived value of designers
- [ ] MR: update colors to match personal ID system
- [ ] APS: show micro ID system overview
- [ ] Rothko: photoshoot outside of my holding fabric poster(s) https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGUOs_rMTE/?img_index=1
- [ ] Social media design ~~~~ need it in portfolio now! (thesis so far)
- [ ] Rothko: update all book imgs, missing some stills instead of all gifs
- [ ] Rothko: try to match background colors to the brand gray tone
- [ ] Rothko: why is the book cover so pixelated, esp PBS logo? investigate
- [ ] ALL CAPTIONS: add periods at the end check emmmmm
- [ ] add more 3D stuff to labyrinth
- [ ] TPS: process is missing
- [ ] Can update bio to speak about trained as a designer all along (clearly explain why I changed careers)

## From Petrula

don’t say microsite
- hiring + creative talent
- less spreads for Rothko, less motion on egawa just make it stills
- say documentary
- better transition between projects
- thesis at the end + lead in with speaking
- research was informed by deep research, the next project is also a deep exploration of that + includes my work for Mark Rothko

## Positioning reflection @ graduation

I have the rest of my life to prove this thesis - this is my design philosophy

There’s nothing left to prove, I already did that throughout my entire MFA before this

like PV said “I’m already over-qualified to speak about my thesis”

I need to claim my expertise, balance with humility

I didn’t come to accd to become a GD, but edu limits that scope + industry definition of GD…. 
——> would be more respected in 20 years
— > I never wanted to be the BEST GD

Teaching would be rly good for me, but need to find a better fit

Hermes - highest vis sponsored studio ever, and being the TA is the validation fs


## Grad show

- [ ] Can turn this into a project page for branding / personal ID with lots of documentation, grad show, EGD, motion, 3D models, etc.
- [ ] Link to to graduation walk, maybe make a YT clip: https://youtu.be/SASQKIg3VY4?t=5040
- [ ] I am running into lots of issues here... Can show a 3D model of the wall too, host on sketchfab w/ annotations: https://support.fab.com/s/article/Annotations
    - [ ] See also: https://github.com/sketchfab/blender-plugin/releases/tag/1.6.1
- [ ] Spinning 3D model of biz card would be so cool
- [ ] Include thesis process images

# P3


- [ ] hmm (security) Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links
- [ ] Labyrinth: bring src/projects/mark-rothko/img/Rothko-AR-demo.png over
- [ ] MJ: keep working on lighting in the installation scene, renders have some odd ghosting on the left side from the HDR
- [ ] TPS maybe show lightsail itself in the motion reveal?
- [ ] TPS make the 30s trailer idea I’ve been thinking about with music, etc.
- [ ] TPS: digital signage motion posters
    - [ ] may be easier in p5.js 2.0 instead of vibe coding... https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/worldtoscreen/; and custom shaders https://beta.p5js.org/tutorials/intro-to-glsl/; https://beta.p5js.org/examples/advanced-canvas-rendering-shader-as-a-texture/
- [ ] more micro touchpoints, so many beautiful print materials - especially the vellum and metallic stuff. Play with Blender renders on this
    - [ ] https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/131930/translucent-material-a-sheet-of-paper-with-image-texture
- [ ] merch - where’s the jacket + hat?
- [ ] MR: some ephemera like all 12 astrology sign info cards or stickers idk
- [ ] MR: lifestyle brand packaging mockups (actually, can just make a whole pkg lifestyle brand)
- [ ] Media-specific pages could have more detail/context, scrollable images... TBD
    - [x] Type design list page (ideally I have all the tag-specific pages auto generated, otherwise I can curate the ones I need by skill (type design, branding, motion, editorial, web))
- [ ] MJ: show prompts
- [ ] Ontology: re-export all the gif/avif spread-mockups at higher res, the small type is a bit pixelated
- [ ] maybe add a spacer for empty grid divs... https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/shakeelmohamed.github.io/pull/181#discussion_r2114879681; see also https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/shakeelmohamed.github.io/pull/181#discussion_r2114880664
- [ ] multi-column text settings for all fonts would be helpful to see


## LATER

- [ ] Explore using fluid typography... how does this fit w/ Tailwind?
    - [ ] https://fluidtypography.com/#usarusFluidTypographyGetStarted
    - [ ] https://codepen.io/iamryanyu/pen/gbpWGYQ
- [ ] Overall, consider bringing in on-scroll animations just really get them clean - or just use those tools for projects... see https://motion.dev/
- [ ] How might I reframe all projects to speak to expertise vs. the project… (e.g. More about me… through Rothko….. vs. about Rothko)
- [ ] How can symbol make it onto the about page? ugh
- [ ] Update all website meta descriptions, “holds an MFA” is not so interesting
- [ ] check favicon colors against printed materials
- [ ] Look at some SEO tricks for primary featured images, could be nice to get my whole portfolio showing in search results: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32577999/how-can-i-add-schema-org-primaryimageofpage-in-my-site
- [ ] Setup 404 tracking w/ GA: https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/track-404-errors-with-google-analytics-google-tag-manager/#ga4-gtm
- [ ] Design 404 page; https://www.404s.design/; consider an opportunity for generative design
- [ ] Fix issues with mobile font tester [WIP might be okay now]
- [ ] All through MFA I was working on typefaces because they did X for me; the result is I can see comms symbols/forms in a whole new way. I understand the rigor of what it takes to find mastery of craft. [In interviews, speak about myself vs. describing the fonts themselves, consider speaking to hiring manager as non-designers.] How will it benefit a team?
    - [ ] ...(related) I have been modifying type for identity projects (Rothko and MJ) which began my interest in type design
- [ ] Salgirah: can move it into labyrinth if I want to keep it anywhere (I’d rather keep it as a hidden page)
- [ ] Labyrinth: include more things like WHP, community photos, etc.
- [ ] WHP: maybe rename since Studio Matthews had a show called “your words have power”
- [ ] Labyrinth description: value is my intelligent approach to work, skillful ability to work in simplicity and complexity, dedication to community, learning in formal/informal/digital settings - one of my biggest strengths
- [ ] TODO: optimize email obfuscation: https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/shakeelmohamed.github.io/pull/161#discussion_r1976589880; and https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/shakeelmohamed.github.io/pull/161#discussion_r1976589879
- [ ] overall tailwind class exceptions need to be optimized: https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/shakeelmohamed.github.io/pull/161#discussion_r1976589881


## My notes
- [ ] Start posting on Behance!
- [ ] MJ: could 3D model the exterior facade for the conf, and make a wayfinding program with a clear system + grid
- [ ] Tests would be nice
- [ ] Rework projects to have a cover.png shown at the top (ideally its the same image as the OG, just scaled up + higher res) -> scale should be about 1920x1200, the OG size feels too wide for cover images
- [ ] Perhaps use cover.png instead of opengraph for project thumbnails
- [ ] Can include small images for AIGA talks on about page... BELOW the resume area
- [ ] Mindful Roman - poster has kinda tight leading on the 3 paragraphs, I think... need to check at full scale
- [ ] Mindful Roman - do some motion gifs/stills of the font2 specimen sheets I made, fun play on the day/night concept
- [ ] Mindful Roman - gendesign whole astrology chart... oh yeah
- [ ] Overall, I need to clean up all overview descriptions, there are a bit loose at the moment. Writing center is a good move there.
- [ ] Salgirah + others, fix weird images sizes + replace all content, can make it flatter + break up the carousels so it reads cleanly
- [ ] Revisit footer design, some inspo: https://www.footer.design/, https://www.footer.design/styles/typographic
- [ ] Do I need avif fallback? Ontology is using them and it’s really nice... can I get away with no gifs on the website?


## Low priority

- [ ] Redo mockups for TPS tickets, start from a clean INDD file -> PSD, maybe even do Blender mockups
- [ ] learn about noreferrer, etc: https://linkbuilder.io/rel-noopener-noreferrer/
- [ ] Rework semantics for SEO for: h1/h2/etc
- [ ] JS to prevent bad breaks (widows / orphans)
- [ ] - [ ] Responsive image loading... add avif/etc optimized loadtime support; see https://github.com/saneef/eleventy-plugin-img2picture
- [ ] figure out how to show extra process (another slider, hidden section, etc.)
- [ ] do I need to do anything with artsthread profile? recognition? https://www.artsthread.com/portfolios/applied-designer-mfa-thesis

## Consider Revisiting

- [ ] Footer: need a home link (rough added to my name, can it be more obvious) + headshot and clear CTA
- [ ] Footer: on project pages, can have a next/prev project (need some logic for that)
- [ ] Capitalize first letter of first tag (homepage under each project, and thesis page), within a project page, capitalize like “Media: Poster”; and then lowercase homepage “Branding, typography, leadership” to be consistent
- [ ] HSTS support via cloudflare? Not sure if this still works with github pages
- [ ] ALL CAPTIONS: automate check for periods at the end


## Ontology notes re: Arabic

- [ ] Kourosh Beigpour’s typeface was Arabic, then Latin also!
      Lots of testing proofing info https://github.com/Tarobish/Mirza
