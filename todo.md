# TODO

- [ ] Salgirah + others, fix weird images sizes + replace all content
- [ ] Add meta descriptions for all project pages 
- [ ] Rework projects to have a cover.png shown at the top (ideally its the same image as the OG, just scaled up + higher res) -> scale should be about 1920x1200, the OG size feels too wide for cover images
- [ ] Perhaps use cover.png instead of opengraph for project thumbnails
- [ ] add avif/etc optimized loadtime support
- [ ] figure out how to generate the tag pages (e.g. .com/branding)
- [ ] figure out how to show extra process (another slider, hidden section, etc.)
- [ ] Fix issues with mobile font tester
- [ ] Can include small images for AIGA talks on about page... BELOW the resume area
- [ ] nice to have: setup a contact card button for grad show: https://vcard.link/card
