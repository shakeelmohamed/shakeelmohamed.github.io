# TODO

## ✅ Phase 1: Image Optimization - COMPLETE
- Migrated to Eleventy 2.0.1 and updated dependencies (Tailwind CSS, Pug)
- Manual optimization of critical images (5MB → 406KB, 912KB → 41KB)
- Automated image processing with responsive picture elements
- Results: ~95% reduction in image file sizes for critical assets

## ✅ Phase 2: Critical CSS Optimization - COMPLETE
- Implemented CSS minification with cssnano
- Created critical CSS extraction and inlining system
- Added non-blocking CSS loading with preload
- Automated build process integration
- CSS analysis tools for performance insights
- Manual critical CSS applied to key pages (homepage, inclusion-tee, about)
- Results: 82KB CSS with ~2KB critical, 80KB deferred

## 🚀 Current Achievements:
- **~95% reduction** in image file sizes for critical assets
- **Non-blocking CSS loading** for faster perceived performance
- **Modern build pipeline** with automated optimizations
- **Performance analysis tools** for ongoing monitoring
- **Development workflow preservation** while adding production optimizations

## 🎯 Next Priority: Media File Optimization
- **32MB typo-AR.mp4** - needs compression/format conversion
- **8MB+ animated GIFs** - need WebP conversion or optimization
- **Multiple 4MB+ images** for manual optimization pipeline

## 💡 Implementation Summary:
- **Phase 1**: Optimized critical images with Eleventy Image + manual processing
- **Phase 2**: Built comprehensive critical CSS system with PurifyCSS
- **Result**: Massive performance improvements while maintaining design aesthetic

Ready for Phase 3 media optimization when you''"re ready!
