# TODO

- [ ] Add meta descriptions for all project pages 
- [ ] Rework projects to have a cover.png shown at the top (ideally its the same image as the OG, just scaled up + higher res)
- [ ] Perhaps use cover.png instead of opengraph for project thumbnails
- [ ] Salgirah + others, fix weird images sizes + replace all content
- [ ] add avif/etc optimized loadtime support
- [ ] figure out how to generate the tag pages (e.g. .com/branding)
- [ ] figure out how to show extra process (another slider, hidden section, etc.)


## Done

- [X] Test DNS origin rule with subdomains... this might solve the 2 domain issue: https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/examples/change-uri-path-and-host-header/ (solved with simple redirect of shakeel.design to shakeelmohamed.com)
- [X] Update all opengraph images (1200 x 630) [Done: Mindful Roman, Referential Mono, TYPO, Salgirah, Thesis, Rothko, MJ, TPS, inclusion tee, Lyric posters]
