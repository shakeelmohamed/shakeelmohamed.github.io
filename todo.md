# TODO

## DONE

- [X] About: Period after “the” in PD quote
- [X] Rothko: Can just say “table of contents” above on right column
- [X] Rothko: can move Sean Adams photo out, can move to about me page instead [also the description of former chair... ya not great]
- [X] Rothko: OOPS there’s a repetition of carousel w/ the 2-up grid
- [X] Rothko: What was the AR experience? Might be moved to labyrinth
- [X] Rothko: caption for Inventing the Alphabet - does that go italics or something? check it + just run it by her if changing it
- [X] SLIGHLTLY more margin above captions, ~4pt equivelent
- [X] About me: “on site in Los Angeles”, not super critical but an easy fix to update everywhere
- [X] Thesis: month+year for AIGA conf
- [X] Thesis: crazy line breaks on right column, whyyyy

## In progress

- [ ] All projects: restructure the special thanks to (remove colon, say “instructors... ”) for those people so we know who there. [Done: MJ, TODO: thesis, Rothko, TYPO, Salgirah, RM, MR]
- [ ] MJ: David Holz on blue conf poster is larger type than others... well he’s the CEO but maybe they should just be the same size
- [ ] Thesis: overall clean it up ASAP and remove the note about it...
- [ ] Thesis: what are the points of my talk? some high level ideas, or takeaways... still unclear what I am bringing to expand the perceived value of designers
- [ ] About page heroes: “how much I have dedicated the paste 4 years to involving myself in design communities to enrich my experience + share the experiences with others, building my design leadership experiences”; currently it is too much just hero worship... dedication to me and to the people I work with to bring communities together (one of the more valuable things that I do together)

- [ ] TYPO: maybe the goal is too ambitious lol
- [ ] TYPO: needs captions + design decisions for why black and white
- [ ] Salgirah: remove portfolio festival video. Maybe just keep it linked from about page in the mini-resume thing
- [ ] Salgirah: can move it into labyrinth if I want to keep it anywhere (I’d rather keep it as a hidden page)
- [ ] ALL CAPTIONS: add periods at the end check emmmmm

## Consider Revisiting

- [X] Footer: need a home link (rough added to my name, can it be more obvious)
- [X] Footer: on project pages, can have a next/prev project (need some logic for that)
- [X] Capitalize first letter of first tag (homepage under each project, and thesis page), within a project page, capitalize like “Media: Poster”; and then lowercase homepage “Branding, typography, leadership” to be consistent

## My notes

- [ ] Salgirah + others, fix weird images sizes + replace all content
- [ ] Add meta descriptions for all project pages 
- [ ] Rework projects to have a cover.png shown at the top (ideally its the same image as the OG, just scaled up + higher res) -> scale should be about 1920x1200, the OG size feels too wide for cover images
- [ ] on large screens, images max out in size at 1920 and have a huge right margin sometimes
- [ ] Perhaps use cover.png instead of opengraph for project thumbnails
- [ ] add avif/etc optimized loadtime support
- [ ] figure out how to generate the tag pages (e.g. .com/branding)
- [ ] figure out how to show extra process (another slider, hidden section, etc.)
- [ ] Fix issues with mobile font tester
- [ ] Can include small images for AIGA talks on about page... BELOW the resume area
- [ ] nice to have: setup a contact card button for grad show: https://vcard.link/card
- [ ] Mindful Roman - poster has kinda tight leading on the 3 paragraphs, I think... need to check at full scale
- [ ] Overall, I need to clean up all overview descriptions, there are a bit loose at the moment. Writing center is a good move there.


## Done

- [X] Test DNS origin rule with subdomains... this might solve the 2 domain issue: https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/examples/change-uri-path-and-host-header/ (solved with simple redirect of shakeel.design to shakeelmohamed.com)
- [X] Update all opengraph images (1200 x 630) [Done: Mindful Roman, Referential Mono, TYPO, Salgirah, Thesis, Rothko, MJ, TPS, inclusion tee, Lyric posters]
