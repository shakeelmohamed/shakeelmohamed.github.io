<p>I’m a senior computer science student at Seattle University. For my senior project I’m working with 3 CS classmates and Expedia, Inc. to prototype a new travel experience mobile app. Our project is conceptually similar to Airbnb. We mashed the word bed into Expedia and came up with Ex <strong>bed</strong> ia (pronounced: Ex-bed-ee-uh) as our project name. <strong>For our app we needed to design a logo, so I thought I’d ask my coworker Brian for some help.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="ohyeahletsjustdoitinpowerpoint">“Oh, yeah. Let’s just do it in PowerPoint.”</h2>
  <h4 id="brianreyessruxdesigner">— Brian Reyes (Sr. UX Designer)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait. PowerPoint for design!? He went on to explain how some people use PowerPoint for design mockups because it’s easily available, and people generally know how to use it.</p>
<p>I was thinking this would be a total disaster, but it was actually a lot of fun. I should probably note here that I’ve been interested in UX/design for the past few years but haven’t pursued my interests — until now.</p>
<h2 id="thetutorial">The “Tutorial”</h2>
<p><img src="./expedia-logo.png" alt="Expedia logo" /></p>
<p>Brian was all about keeping the logo <strong>simple</strong>. I thought it would take maybe 5 minutes, at most. We decided to go with a cheesy logo to match our cheesy project name.</p>

  <p>“Let’s just swap the plane with a bed, and change the text.” — Brian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We spent about <strong>20 minutes</strong> to get something primitive.</p>
<p><img src="primitive-bed-logo.png" alt="Primitive bed logo" /></p>
<p>Immediately I realized this is going to take a bit longer than expected. In that short time though, Brian helped me out with these key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research what styles Expedia uses.</strong> We found a branding guide with a quick search.</li>
<li><strong>Find the font.</strong> According to that guide they use <em>Geometric 415 Medium</em>, we found a free download of the .ttf.</li>
<li><strong>Find the colors.</strong> I had to play around with the colors in the guide a bit, but ended up with the RGB values of 255, 216, 68 (yellow) and 0, 54, 88 (blue).</li>
<li><strong>Remove any trademark/copyright symbols.</strong> Because legal problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I spent about <strong>8 hours</strong> designing &amp; redesigning the logo several times because I was having so much fun.</p>

<p><strong>Rather than showing 30+ captioned images of the step-by-step process, I’ve cleaned up my PowerPoint, added titles, and uploaded it to SlideShare. It’s embedded below!</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/6JVe4eLdFUYx3K" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
<p>I think the best feature in PowerPoint for designers is <strong>slide duplication</strong>. A great workflow is duplicating the current slide after every change. Then at the end, you can <strong>see the progress of your work by just viewing the slideshow</strong> in order!</p>
<h2 id="protips">Pro tips!</h2>
<p>When you’re ready to export your logo the process is pretty simple. Group all the objects you want, resize the image (bigger is better to avoid pixelation). Then right-click and click “Save as Picture…”. Then you can save it as a PNG file and you’re done!</p>
<p>Some other helpful features, for designing in PowerPoint:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grouping</strong>. You can move several items together, but they’re still separate.</li>
<li><strong>Align to Center/Middle and Distribute Vertically/Horizontally.</strong> These were mainly for cleaning everything up nicely for the slideshow — but they saved a ton of time.</li>
<li><strong>Straight lines.</strong> It’s really easy to roll your own custom grid to make sure things line up correctly!</li>
<li><strong>Move to Front/Back and Move Forward/Backward.</strong> PowerPoint doesn't have proper “layers” like Adobe software. Each thing is it’s own layer.</li>
<li><strong>The zoom slider.</strong> It’s helpful to quickly magnify/shrink what you’re working on to get a better perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inclosing">In Closing</h2>
<p>I think this is just the start of my design career. It was empowering to know that <strong>I can get my ideas to an actual, usable, design in just a few hours.</strong> If I had to do this using the software I thought I needed to use (Adobe products) — I could’ve easily spent days trying to do something simple and lost my inspiration in the process.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is this: <strong>don’t feel like you need expensive software to do something.</strong> Find an unconventional way to do it. As a hacker, I do things the unconventional way for a living. In the end, this was just another hack.
