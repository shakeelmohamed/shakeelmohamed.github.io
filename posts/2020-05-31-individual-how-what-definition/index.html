<blockquote>
  <p>If you haven't read my previous post on <a href="../2020-04-30-individual-why-discovery">Finding Your Individual Why Statement</a>, this one won't make much sense so please start there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To quickly recap, a WHY statement follows the format: <em>To [<strong>contribution</strong>] so that [<strong>impact</strong>]</em>. My individual why statement is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>To relentlessly pursue being world-class, so that we can experience beyond what's possible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one epic statement that gets me excited, and ready to jump out of bed in the morning! So now let's get into defining my HOWs and WHATs.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2yOfH8T">Find Your Why</a> if Golden Circle Theory is appealing to you.</p>
<h2 id="okaynowwhat">Okay, now what?</h2>
<p>I got the WHY, awesome. What I do with this cool sentence now?
Let's revisit the Golden Circle, WHY is at the center which is followed by the HOWs and the WHATs. </p>
<p><img src="https://simonsinek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GC_slide-2.jpg" alt="Golden Circle Theory" /></p>
<p>I'll expound upon these two in detail before sharing my individual HOWs and WHATs so will make a bit more sense.</p>
<h2 id="howsapproachtodoing">HOWs - approach to doing</h2>
<p>HOWs are the the methods, the approaches, the way that an individual uniquely goes about their life. The HOWs also have a process to go through defining them, this step is independent. Once one has completed the individual why discovery, they will have a list of themes common among the stories they've shared. One of those themes is the <strong>contribution</strong>, the other is the <strong>impact</strong> which were used in the WHY statement. Eliminate those from the list to begin the HOW definition process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Narrow down the list of themes to at most 5, you may want to combine or remove similar themes at this step.</li>
<li>State your HOWs, they will follow a solid structure. (e.g.: "Learn something from everyone"). Use active language, start with a verb, remove "ing" from verbs, be as concise as you can.</li>
<li>Provide context to each HOW, give it a little bit of flavor. Describe the actions of your HOWs with a brief statement. (e.g.: "Assume there is always a solution, and don't give up until you find it").</li>
</ol>
<p>When I went through this process, I  really tightened up my HOWs. This brevity worked for me, it might not work for everyone.</p>
<p>My HOWs, or my competitive advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outwork deficiencies<ul>
<li>Any weakness can be overcome with great effort.</li></ul></li>
<li>Create the future<ul>
<li>Start with the end in mind, work towards the plan, adjust as needed.</li></ul></li>
<li>Seek growth constantly<ul>
<li>Knowledge is power, so learn from the greats; success leaves clues.</li></ul></li>
<li>Enable understanding through transparency<ul>
<li>Use clear &amp; direct communication, translate if necessary.</li></ul></li>
<li>Think from a unique perspective<ul>
<li>Think inside, outside, and about the box itself.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These are AWESOME! They feel like my own core life principles! (Shout out to Ray Dalio's incredible book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Mfxkl9">Principles)</a>. I feel totally aligned and juiced up when I see this list. These are the 5 ways I've survived through life, it's like looking at a blueprint for the past decade!</p>
<h2 id="whats">WHATs</h2>
<p>WHATs are what you do. This section of the Golden Circle Theory takes the least amount of effort to define, you already know what you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. This is an opportunity to add some descriptive juice to those activities to reframe how you you think about your life.</p>
<p>If I were to list out functional "tasks" that I personally do, it looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineering</li>
<li>Graphic design</li>
<li>Brand strategy</li>
<li>Read books</li>
<li>Write blog posts</li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Travel</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these things might change relatively often. For example, a few years ago I wasn't exposed to graphic design or brand strategy - and nobody is traveling right now due to the global pandemic.</p>
<p>So instead, I wanted to make my WHATs a little more fluid to span multiple "tasks". Here's what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synthesize - bringing ideas from different domains to innovate</li>
<li>Elevate - constantly raising standards</li>
<li>Align - getting others on the same page</li>
<li>Lead - selecting a direction, and getting others to join me</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing those down to 4 words feels like it summarizes my approach to any task: <strong>synthesize</strong>, <strong>elevate</strong>, <strong>align</strong>, and <strong>lead</strong> (which is easy to remember with an acronym <strong>SEAL</strong>). I believe those four happen are in order as well: before elevating one must get all the information (synthesize), and before leading one must have all of their focus on a clear direction (alignment).</p>
<h2 id="thanksforreading">Thanks for reading!</h2>
<p>I plan to continue writing about Golden Circle Theory and WHY discovery as I learn more through the process. There's still a lot I have to learn as a facilitator, and the really interesting stuff: group WHY discovery. I have some things planned and hope to share them soon. If you have any questions about WHY discovery - let's talk!</p></div>
