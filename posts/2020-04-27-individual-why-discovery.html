<p>I've been intrigued by Simon Sinek's work for many years. I knew his Golden Circle Theory is an incredible idea but, I didn't know how to apply it in my daily life.</p>
<h2 id="goldencircletheory">Golden Circle Theory</h2>
<p>Fill me in, like Craig David's best song.</p>
<h2 id="howdidwegethere">How did we get here?</h2>
<p>When confronted with some challenges as a leader last year, I sought the guidance of one of my mentors. "Think about <strong>alignment</strong> with your goal, and their beliefs." This really got me thinking, "what do other people care about?". Then I remembered Simon's TED talk about Golden Circle Theory, and that his first book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/B074VF6ZLM/"><em>Start With Why</em></a> was on my reading list. So I read it over a few weeks. I was already familiar with the concept however, so I didn't receive as much value as I would've had it been fresh. To put that in context, the book came before his TED talkâ€¦ back in 2009!</p>
<p>Once I finished reading <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/B074VF6ZLM/"><em>Start With Why</em></a>, I felt a little bit empty inside. I had many examples and evidence for <em>WHY</em> Golden Circle Theory is so effective. I still didn't know how to apply it to my life, or any team I am involved with. After very quick Amazon search, found that Simon had recently co-authored a book, called <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Find-Your-Why-Practical-Discovering-ebook/dp/B01CZCW3ZA/"><em>Find Your Why</em></a>. This is where our journey begins.</p>

<h2 id="thanksforreading">Thanks for reading!</h2>
<p>I've prepared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TvHbdOGD_CZX09jVzrVO2OKZQq4Y8Xbncbbc68h1vzY/edit?usp=sharing">Google doc</a> with everything you need to get started for discovering or facilitating an individual why statement.</p>
<p>I plan to continue writing about Golden Circle Theory and Why Discovery as I learn more through the process. If you have any questions about Why Discovery - let's talk!</p></div>
