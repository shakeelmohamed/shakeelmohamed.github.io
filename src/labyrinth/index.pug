            p Design, like a labyrinth, is not about rushing to the end but discovery along the way. Unlike a maze, which focuses on solving and escaping, a labyrinth invites mindful exploration. The winding path of creativity reflects the cyclical nature of design. Each project offers new ideas and insights building upon the last.
        div
            p This is my home for archived, unpolished, philosophical creative exploration.
