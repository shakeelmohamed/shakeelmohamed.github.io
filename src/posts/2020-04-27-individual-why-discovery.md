# Finding Your Individual Why Statement

I've been intrigued by Simon Sinek's work for many years. I knew his Golden Circle Theory is an incredible idea but, I didn't know how to apply it in my daily life.

## Golden Circle Theory

Fill me in, like Craig David's best song.

## How did we get here?

When confronted with some challenges as a leader last year, I sought the guidance of one of my mentors. "Think about **alignment** with your goal, and their beliefs." This really got me thinking, "what do other people care about?". Then I remembered Simon's TED talk about Golden Circle Theory, and that his first book [_Start With Why_](https://smile.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/B074VF6ZLM/) was on my reading list. So I read it over a few weeks. I was already familiar with the concept however, so I didn't receive as much value as I would've had it been fresh. To put that in context, the book came before his TED talk... back in 2009!

Once I finished reading [_Start With Why_](https://smile.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/B074VF6ZLM/), I felt a little bit empty inside. I had many examples and evidence for _WHY_ Golden Circle Theory is so effective. I still didn't know how to apply it to my life, or any team I am involved with. After very quick Amazon search, found that Simon had recently co-authored a book, called [_Find Your Why_](https://smile.amazon.com/Find-Your-Why-Practical-Discovering-ebook/dp/B01CZCW3ZA/). This is where our journey begins.

I've prepared a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TvHbdOGD_CZX09jVzrVO2OKZQq4Y8Xbncbbc68h1vzY/edit?usp=sharing) with everything you need to get started for discovering or facilitating an individual why statement.

I plan to continue writing about Golden Circle Theory and Why Discovery as I learn more through the process. If you have any questions about Why Discovery - let's talk!
