# Defining Your Individual HOWs and WHATs (Golden Circle Theory, part 2)

> If you haven't read my previous post on [Finding Your Individual Why Statement](../2020-04-30-individual-why-discovery), this one won't make much sense so please start there.

To quickly recap, a WHY statement follows the format: *To [**contribution**] so that [**impact**]*. My individual why statement is:

> **To relentlessly pursue being world-class, so that we can experience beyond what's possible.**

That's one epic statement that gets me excited, and ready to jump out of bed in the morning! So now let's get into defining my HOWs and WHATs.

I highly recommend reading [Find Your Why](https://amzn.to/2yOfH8T) if Golden Circle Theory is appealing to you.

## Okay, now what?

I got the WHY, awesome. What I do with this cool sentence now?
Let's revisit the Golden Circle, WHY is at the center which is followed by the HOWs and the WHATs.

I'll expound upon these two in detail before sharing my individual HOWs and WHATs so will make a bit more sense.


## HOWs 

My HOWs, or my competitive advantages are:

* Outwork deficiencies
  - Any weakness can be overcome with great effort.
* Create the future
   - Start with the end in mind, work towards the plan, adjust as needed.
* Seek growth constantly
  - Knowledge is power, so learn from the greats; success leaves clues.
* Enable understanding through transparency
  - Use clear & direct communication, translate if necessary.
* Think from a unique perspective
  - Think inside, outside, and about the box itself.

These are AWESOME! They feel like my own core life principles! (Shout out to Ray Dalio's incredible book, [Principles)](https://amzn.to/2Mfxkl9).

## WHATs

WHATs are what you do. This section of the Golden Circle Theory takes the least amount of effort to define, you already know what you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. This is an opportunity to add some descriptive juice to those activities to reframe how you you think about your life.

If I were to list out functional "tasks" that I personally do, it looks like this:

* Software engineering
* Graphic design
* Brand strategy
* Read books
* Write blog posts
* Volunteer
* Travel

However, these things might change relatively often. For example, a few years ago I wasn't exposed to graphic design or brand strategy - and nobody is traveling right now due to the global pandemic.

So instead, I wanted to make my WHATs a little more fluid to span multiple "tasks". Here's what I came up with:

* Synthesize - bringing ideas from different domains to innovate
* Elevate - constantly raising standards
* Align - getting others on the same page
* Lead - selecting a direction, and getting others to join me

Reducing those down to 4 words feels like it summarizes my approach to any task: **synthesize**, **elevate**, **align**, and **lead** (which is easy to remember with an acronym **SEAL**). I believe those four happen are in order as well: before elevating one must get all the information (synthesize), and before leading one must have all of their focus on a clear direction (alignment).

## Thanks for reading!

I plan to continue writing about Golden Circle Theory and WHY discovery as I learn more through the process. There's still a lot I have to learn as a facilitator, and the really interesting stuff: group WHY discovery. I have some things planned and hope to share them soon. If you have any questions about WHY discovery - let's talk!
