# Defining Your Individual HOWs and WHATs (Golden Circle Theory, part 2)

> If you haven't read my previous post on [Finding Your Individual Why Statement](../2020-04-30-individual-why-discovery), this one won't make much sense so please start there.

To quickly recap, a WHY statement follows the format: *To [**contribution**] so that [**impact**]*. My individual why statement is:

> **To relentlessly pursue being world-class, so that we can experience beyond what's possible.**

That's one epic statement that gets me excited, and ready to jump out of bed in the morning! So now let's get into defining my HOWs and WHATs.

## HOWs

## WHATs

WHATs are what you do. This section of the Golden Circle Theory takes the least amount of effort to define, you already know what you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. This is an opportunity to add some descriptive juice to those activities to reframe how you you think about your life.

If I were to list out functional "tasks" that I personally do, it looks like this:

* Software engineering
* Graphic design
* Brand strategy
* Read books
* Write blog posts
* Volunteer
* Travel

However, these things might change relatively often. For example, a few years ago I wasn't exposed to graphic design or brand strategy - and nobody is traveling right now due to the global pandemic.

So instead, I wanted to make my WHATs a little more fluid to span multiple "tasks". Here's what I came up with:

* Synthesize - bringing ideas from different domains to innovate
* Elevate - constantly raising standards
* Align - getting others on the same page
* Lead - selecting a direction, and getting others to join me
