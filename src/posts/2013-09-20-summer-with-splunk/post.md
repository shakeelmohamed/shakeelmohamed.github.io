#Summer with Splunk

This summer I received an unexpected opportunity to be a software engineer intern at Splunk’s Seattle office.

I applied fully on a whim. I mean really. I didn’t even bother writing a cover letter, it seemed impossibly out of reach for me. But somehow my resume alone was enough to continue the hiring process, and I did well enough in my interviews to get an offer. No complaints from me! :)

My first work task involved minor changes to the [Splunk SDK for JavaScript](http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAECM). This got me re-interested in Node.js, and prompted me to begin building [Today Was](https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/today-was) in Node.

Then I transitioned into bringing [modular input](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/5.0.4/AdvancedDev/ModInputsIntro) support to the [Splunk SDK for Python in version 1.1](http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAEBB). I really appreciated this task because it was a major feature that developers would use, and a chance for me to learn most of Python in about 3-4 weeks (crazy!).

But it hasn’t been all work. A few weeks ago the whole office went to a Mariner’s game for “intern day”, although I’m no longer a baseball fan I didn’t mind the view from a suite!

Since that time, I’ve been working on a demo using the new [Splunk App Framework Beta](http://dev.splunk.com/view/app-framework/SP-CAAAEMA).

A couple random things I’ve loved about my internship include getting to use a MacBook Pro and a standing desk.

Earlier this week my [blog post](http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/09/10/the-splunk-sdk-for-python-gets-modular-input-support/) on my work on the Splunk SDK for Python went live, which has me re-interested in blogging. Next Friday would’ve been the last day of my internship, but my internship has been extended to part-time through the school year — PERFECT.
