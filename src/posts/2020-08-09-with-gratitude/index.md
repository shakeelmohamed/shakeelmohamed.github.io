If you've ever received a personal email from me, you know I have one standard email signature: "with gratitude." 😇

Some of you may be thinking, "oh, it's just his email signature that he thought of one day and now it's mindless." 🙄

Well, that's half true, I did think of it one day. I also hate email signatures, because they never seem to work correctly on my phone and sometimes don't show up at all. ❌

Here's my point: I type out my email signature. Every. Single. Time. Every. Single. Email. 👨🏻‍💻

It forces me to reflect and mindfully type out the words "with" and "gratitude", which reminds me to return to a state of gratitude. Often in the middle of a busy day. ❤️

Even the rote act of sending emails can become a mindful activity if you wish it to be. 😎

With gratitude,
