# 10 Lessons From My 10 Year Journey

June 2020. I had no idea where I would be 10 years ago when I graduated from high school. I remember the pain I felt that day after graduation when my new reality finally set in. I was not going to university, like all of my peers. I cried like a baby that day, but I made one decision: I had to get serious for the first time in my life.

That summer began to teach myself to write C# code, which gave me a decent familiarity with object oriented programming before I began taking computer science courses at Bellevue College.

More importantly, I began an incredible journey of personal development. One day that summer I found this old book that my uncle had given me a few years ago. I read these words on the cover and felt like I had discovered buried treasure: "This book could be worth a million dollars to you". I hadn't even opened the [_Think and Grow Rich_](https://amzn.to/2YMBlV8) until that moment, and it changed my life forever.

These are 10 lessons I've learned throughout the 10 year journey of my adult life. These lessons are in chronological order, and each lesson was learned for a specific book.

### 1. Set goals. Pursue them with everything you've got: [Think and Grow Rich, by Napoleon Hill](https://amzn.to/2YMBlV8)

The summer of 2010 was the first time I ever set a goal, in my life. I won't get into specifics, but the chapter on goal setting alone changed my entire approach to life. I used to think I was a very type B personality, and have since embraced my true nature as a type A personality. When I achieved one of the financial goals I set for myself with a 30 day timeline, I found an enormous level of confidence. I began to understand that I had enormous potential when I actually applied myself.

### 2. Education is supposed to be painful: [The Republic, by Plato](https://amzn.to/3f1cDX7)

When I was a student at Bellevue College, Philosophy 101 with a required code class. I had a brief exposure to Plato in my World Religions class in my senior year of high school, this was a whole new level of understanding. I began to think critically about many things I used to take for granted as the status quo, which news sources to consume. The process was very painful for me as I was re-educating myself, while also enduring the pain of being a college student. I was actually getting good grades while working a part-time job, but it took a great deal of resilience to get through it all. Plato's allegory of the cave is one of my favorite concepts to this day. I've covered it in at least 3 college courses, and some outside trainings. I even taught the concept to a 4th grade class of Ismaili students during the Saturday religious education classes I used to teach!

### 3. Keep trying different things, and trust the process. You never know where you'll end up, but it will be amazing: [The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho](https://amzn.to/31xF8aU)

Ah, the Alchemist. This was a lovely story, and a tough pillow to swallow when applying the lessons to my life. In high school, I wanted to get into the University of Washington: I was rejected. After I completed my Associate's degree from Bellevue College I still wanted to get into UW: I was rejected. I've attempted many businesses since high school: they've all failed. I wanted to get a job at Google so desperately: I bombed both interviews I've had with them over the years. Many of my dreams were brutally shattered over the years, but I kept adjusting and trying different things.

In hindsight, I was so worried about HOW certain things would happen instead of THAT they happened. I ended up getting a computer science degree from a good University. I ended up getting a job at a great tech company. I ended up reaching a level of financial security I couldn't even dream about 10 years ago. It's been a hell of a ride, and I'm just getting started.

### 4. Reality is negotiable through the 80/20 rule: [The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss](https://amzn.to/2YNxlUH)

üòç The 80/20 rule changed the came for me once I was at Seattle University. I've seen Jack Ma talk about this in a couple of speeches recently, which gives me great joy: you don't have to be a perfect student to be successful. In fact, sometimes it's better to not be perfect so you can free up time to work on other things. I had been strategically slacking in some classes at Bellevue College in order to optimize by time while juggling school, work, and a long bus commute to campus. I leaned into this concept even more at SU, because I realized some classes just didn't need my attention that badly. I found it was acceptable to slack off in some humanities and business courses while I worked on homework for other classes or personal projects.

I was able to learn so much practical knowledge - especially about Node.js by optimizing my time with end in goal, using 20% of my effort to get 80% of the results I needed was incredible. It's been so long since I read 4HWW, I need revisit it and pull out more practical tips.

### 5. Maximize your twenties: [The Defining Decade, by Meg Jay](https://amzn.to/2Zs6yfw)

Setting goals started the fire of my ambition, adding a sense of urgency was like adding gasoline. I realized these 10 years (of which 8.5 are over) were the best time for me to set myself up for success in every area of life. My brain, body, and energy levels were never going be higher outside of my twenties. I created a whole new level of intensity with everything I did because I knew there was a potential end date to every opportunity.

### 6. Without self-love you will suffer: [Gifts of Imperfection, by Bren√© Brown](https://amzn.to/31tScy1)



### 7. People first, then money, then things: [The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous & Broke, by Suze Orman](https://amzn.to/2VwMxmM)

I grew up in a household with little to no financial intelligence, and that's all I'll say about it. The mindset shift to making financial freedom a priority helped me focus so many efforts. Hell yeah I wanted fancy sneakers, but I wanted to never feel the pain of financial stress so much more. I wanted financial security for my single mom as well, it wasn't just about me. The entire journey of personal development was starting with escaping poverty so we could both have a better life. The escape became my number one motivation in life, and let me to pay of all of my student loans within 1 year of graduating from Seattle University.

### 8. Become aware of the talking machine, practice ignoring it: [The Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer](https://amzn.to/3igP7Y3)
<!--  -->
<!-- This one has helped to very clearly untangle the two "things" within the human mind: [the automatic talking machine, and the consciousness. Recognizing the talking machine and knowing when to ignore it has helped me to get out of my own way. The act of reading the words in this book itself was almost meditative. -->

### 9. Only keep/do things which spark joy: [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, by Marie Kondo](https://amzn.to/2VyB3zn)

Marie Kondo is such a soulful person, I loved watching her Netflix show, too. Around this time in my life I was getting overwhelmed with so many things from college and childhood that were just getting in the way. I went through her Konmari process, sort of... and made some big changes. I've always been an aspirational minimalist, this became a very practical way to move in that direction. Talking to old friends sometimes would ruin my energy for multiple days because I'd remember past experiences with them, when I was a ‚Äúlesser person‚Äù back then. They didn't spark joy for me, often the conversations were flat, and we only kept in touch out of familiarity. My time is super valuable, and I don't want to spend it with anyone who I can't spark joy with.

### 10. Alignment is everything: [Find Your Why, by Simon Sinek](https://amzn.to/2YObGf1)
