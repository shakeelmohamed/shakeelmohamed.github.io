# Escaping the Trap of Mediocre Coffee

**Life is too short for bad coffee.**

During the p a n d e m i c (are we still calling it that, or did we come up with a trendier name?), restaurants and coffee shops were forced to shut down for public health reasons. Now, I was never a huge coffee drinker and I'm still not. But after a few weeks I was feeling the itch for a nice americano or iced coffee. About a year ago I had a mission to get rid of my Keurig coffee machine since I'd been exposed to better coffee over the years. It was time to get rid of that bug clunky think on my kitchen country, except I had a lot of those little k-cup things that I was not about to throw away.

As I began going through those unsatisfying remaining few k-cups, I started learning more about the various options for brewing coffee at home. I knew I didn't want basic drip coffee, while using minimal equipment and an easy cleanup process. My go to morning drink is plain matcha tea, which is as easy as it gets — add hot water to some powder and stir. That's the level of simplicity I was going for.

Pourover brews from the Chemex as great, but I knew I would get lazy about cleaning the glass flask. So it came down to French Press, moka pot, and an Aeropress. The Moka pot was quickly out because I wanted to have precise temperature control so a stove top brewer would not work. French vs. Aeropress, perhaps one of the most disputed debates within the coffee community (according to my research from dozens of hours on YouTube). One one hand French presses have that timeless aesthetic the brewing options are limited to French press style coffee. I ended up going with an Aeropress for the flexibility to experiment with different brewing methods, and I knew I was brewing just for myself

Brewing method: ✅. Now how do I want to deal with coffee: buy it pre-ground, electric grinder, or hand grinder?
