I took a walk today, listening to music on my phone as I usually do, and an interesting thought came to me. *I often use my headphones to silence my automatic thought process.* Sometimes those thoughts aren’t very resourceful, but a [great song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRmBChQjZPs) can silence them!

I decided to challenge myself to walk the rest of the way with my music paused. After about a minute my thoughts began to speed up. As I ducked under a low-hanging branch I thought...

> “Wow, those leaves are so green”

**In that moment I noticed my mind went totally silent.** I looked at the sky and thought, “The sky is so blue.” After continuing this simple process of identifying colors for a few minutes, my mind was completely at ease. 

Consciously noticing colors was a simple mental task that I didn’t have to think about, but enough to keep my mind from drifting into a negative place.

I think this is an incredibly simple mindfulness exercise that anyone can try, even sitting in an office. You can notice how the gray the grays are if your office is a bit dull :) **Give it a try, and tell me about your experience!**
