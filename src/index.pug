                | Hello, I’m Shakeel! I’m a visual designer in Seattle, specializing in branding and experimental typography. After 10 years of working as a software engineer, I began exploring my creative side. This fall, I will begin an MFA in Graphic Design at ArtCenter College of Design, with the intent of learning more about typography, branding, and design leadership.
