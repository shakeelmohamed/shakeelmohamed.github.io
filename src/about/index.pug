            p My name is Shakeel, I’m a strategic brand designer specializing in identity design, typography, and systems thinking. I approach projects systematically by understanding the brief, audience, and constraints to create brands that work seamlessly across every&nbsp;touchpoint.
            br
            p During my graduate studies at ArtCenter College of Design I designed four typefaces, which gave me a deep appreciation for the power of typography across media types. Designing fonts requires rigorous refinement over minute details, I bring this same attention to craft through form, layout, typesetting, and print&nbsp;production.
            br
            p At Splunk, I was known as “the glue” for my ability to coordinate across teams and translate complex ideas for different audiences from technical to non-technical, from interns to vice presidents. Many of these projects were demonstrated on stage at technology conferences and used by several Fortune 500 companies.
