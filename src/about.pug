            I‚Äôm a visual designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area.

            As someone who never quite fit in, I‚Äôve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: [ISTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ), [capricon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology)), [introvered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion), [type A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory#Type_A), [Ismaili Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism), [Gujarati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_people), [first-generation college graduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_college_students_in_the_United_States).

            I‚Äôm inspired by peak performances, from [Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qXbVyVNnA) to [The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhadTURsrw).

            I‚Äôm currently running my independent design business, [ntrsct (in‚Ä¢ter‚Ä¢sect) designs](https://ntrsct.com), while learning more about design.
            I spend my free time volunteering with [the Ismaili Muslim community](https://the.ismaili/) on projects varying from branding to video production.
