            p.bold.h2 About me
            p I am a Graphic Design MFA Candidate at ArtCenter College of Design, set to graduate in spring 2025. My undergraduate Computer Science degree led me to six years of experience as a software engineer. Along the way, I discovered my passion for graphic design, particularly branding. With my diverse professional experiences as a foundation, I am excited for my career ahead as a designer. I am highly motivated and always ready to learn.

        :markdown-it(html=true)
            I‚Äôm a developer turned designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area. I had a career as a software engineer before discovering my passion for design, which eventually led to my career transition.

            As someone who never quite fit in, I‚Äôve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: [ISTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ), [Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology)), [introverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion), [type A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory#Type_A), [Ismaili Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism), [Gujarati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_people), [first-generation college graduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_college_students_in_the_United_States).

            I‚Äôm inspired by peak performances, from [Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qXbVyVNnA) to [The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhadTURsrw).

            I‚Äôm currently running my independent design business, [ntrsct (in‚Ä¢ter‚Ä¢sect) designs](https://ntrsct.com), while learning more about design.
            I spend my free time volunteering with [the Ismaili Muslim community](https://the.ismaili/) on projects varying from branding to video production.
