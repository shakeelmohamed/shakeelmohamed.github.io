            I’m a self-taught designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area.

            As someone who never quite fit in, I’ve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: ISTJ, capricon, introvered, type A, Ismaili Muslim, Gujarati, first-generation American.

            I’m inspired by peak performances whether it’s Michael Jordan in the NBA finals, or The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show.

            I spend my free time volunteering with [the Ismaili Muslim community](https://the.ismaili/) on various (sometimes creative) projects.

            I’m currently applying to graduate school MFA programs in graphic design while running my independent design business, [ntrsct (in•ter•sect) designs](https://ntrsct.com).
