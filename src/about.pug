            I‚Äôm a self-taught designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area.

            As someone who never quite fit in, I‚Äôve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: ISTJ, capricon, introvered, type A, Ismaili Muslim, Gujarati, first-generation American.

            I‚Äôm inspired by peak performances whether it‚Äôs Michael Jordan in the NBA finals, or The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show.

            I spend my free time volunteering with [the Ismaili Muslim community](https://the.ismaili/) on various (sometimes creative) projects.

            I‚Äôm currently applying to graduate school MFA programs in graphic design while running my independent design business, [ntrsct (in‚Ä¢ter‚Ä¢sect) designs](https://ntrsct.com).
