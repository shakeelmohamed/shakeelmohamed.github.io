            p I thrive at the intersection of cultures, translating across perspectives to discover new ideas. My elementary school was on a Native American reservation where I was “the other Indian.” Early in life, I understood the nuances of personal identity which primed me for my second career in graphic design.

            p The pursuit of mastery fuels everything I do. As a software engineer, I didn’t just write code; I crafted it to be efficient and elegantly formatted, making it intuitive for other developers. This attention to typography is now at the heart of my practice as a designer. My creative process is a synthesis of research, conversational insights, strategy, and empathy to connect with my audience.

//-             I’m a developer turned designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area. I had a career as a software engineer before discovering my passion for design, which eventually led to my career transition.

//-             As someone who never quite fit in, I’ve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: [ISTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ), [Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology)), [introverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion), [type A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory#Type_A), [Ismaili Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism), [Gujarati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_people), [first-generation college graduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_college_students_in_the_United_States).

//-             I’m inspired by peak performances, from [Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qXbVyVNnA) to [The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhadTURsrw).

//-             I’m currently running my independent design business, [ntrsct (in•ter•sect) designs](https://ntrsct.com), while learning more about design.
//-             I spend my free time volunteering with [the Ismaili Muslim community](https://the.ismaili/) on projects varying from branding to video production.
