        I’m a self-taught designer, born and raised in the greater Seattle area. As someone who never quite fit in, I’ve always been curious about how labels shape our identities. These are a few of my labels: ISTJ, capricon, introvered, type A, Ismaili Muslim, Gujarati, first-generation American.


        I’m inspired by peak performances whether it’s Michael Jordan in the NBA finals, or The Weeknd performing at the Super Bowl halftime show.


        I spend my free time volunteering with the Ismaili Muslim community on various projects. I’m currently applying to graduate school programs in graphic design while running my independent design business, ntrsct (in•ter•sect) designs.
