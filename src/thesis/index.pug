            p The true power of graphic designers is realized when we apply our thinking to more than just visual problems.
            p Our industry’s obsession with “the best” is suffocating our creativity through a linear process.

            p It’s time for a new way to understand creative projects, one which allows for room to meander.
            p Design is a labyrinth, not a maze, a mindful creative exploration through skills, projects, collaborators, and insights.

            p I recently gave a talk titled “Deconstructing ‘Best’: Redefining Success for Designers” at a conference hosted by AIGA Los Angeles.
