                    p.text-white In 2018 I started a clothing brand called&nbsp;
                        a(href="https://ntrsct.com") ntrsct
                        | , which has evolved into my independent design business.

                    p.text-white The logomark emerged from my fascination with the numerous aspects of one’s identity and finding ways to embrace them. An X is the simplest expression of an intersection, symbolizing the point where the many elements of our identity meet.
                    br
                    p.text-white Black and white in the graphic symbolize the (illusion of) maximum contrast of our differences. While Virgil Abloh’s brand Off-White stands for the grey area between black and white, I see it differently. To me, black is white.

                    p.text-white The Inclüsion Tee was the best-selling product while running the clothing brand.

                    p.caption.text-white The late Virgil Abloh was the catalyst for my interest in design. One person can change your whole life.

                    p.text-white I chose the German character, ü (u-umlaut), to symbolize the viewer (you) being the source of an inclusive environment—an ode to the reunification of East and West Germany after WWII. It also looks like a smiley face!

                    p.text-white This graphic resonated with me at a time when political and social issues were polarizing the American people.

                    p.caption.text-white From sketch to reality. The figure-ground ambiguity of the X was a happy accident while working in Adobe Illustrator.
