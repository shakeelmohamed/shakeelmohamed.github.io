            While vacationing in Thailand in 2020 (before the pandemic), I came up with a set of journaling prompts to overcome my own limiting beliefs.

            After proving the process on myself for a year, I began to share it with friends with very positive feedback.

            Some highlights include being embraced by Faces from Places (a creative entrepreneur mastermind group) and La Corvata (a Spanish-speaking design and marketing community, with over 30k followers on Instagram).

            This page is a work in progress, stay tuned for some beautiful typography.
