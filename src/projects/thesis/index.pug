            p My thesis explores unique ways to position these skills as transferable beyond traditional careers to help early and mid-career designers pivot into high-value careers. By categorizing design expertise into storytelling, analytical research, strategic thinking, process management, and collaboration, I aim to demonstrate how these capabilities are valued across industries. This is especially relevant now because graphic design positions have been lost and increasingly commoditized through low-cost freelance options, DIY low-effort platforms, and the emergence of generative AI.
