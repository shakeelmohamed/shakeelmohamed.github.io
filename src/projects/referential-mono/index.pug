In this first draft I remained rigid to the same grid as the Latin character set (7x7 without letter-spacing since Arabic is a connected script). In doing so, I found some forms do not reduce down as nicely as I would like. The next revision I will try is on a 14x14 grid, subdividing the current grid in half.")
