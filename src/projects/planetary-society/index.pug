            p Planetary Society is a non-profit organization focused on advocacy for space exploration and based in Pasadena, California. Bill Nye is currently their CEO.
            p Though the Planetary Society focused on space enthusiasts in general, I wanted to expand that a bit. By exploring the profound human experience of our relationship to the massive scale of the cosmos. 
            p Using a primary serif typeface, all brand touchpoints take on an elevated feeling.

            p Removing “The” from the organization’s name allowed for a more recognizable shorthand.
            p I also designed a special brand style for the Society’s 45th anniversary including a custom modular and variable typeface inspired by planetary orbits. For the 45th anniversary I envisioned a weekend celebration event on Catalina Island.
