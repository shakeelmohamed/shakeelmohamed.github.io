            p Though the Planetary Society focused on space enthusiasts in general, I wanted to expand that a bit. By exploring the profound human experience of our relationship to the massive scale of the cosmos. 
            p I also created a special brand style for the Societyâ€™s 45th anniversary including a custom modular and variable typeface inspired by planetary orbits. For the 45th anniversary I envisioned a weekend celebration event on Catalina Island.
