            p Ontology is a full-flavored sans font family. The project began by learning the anatomy of Arabic script through connected and positional letterforms. I was inspired by how the calligraphic gesture still influences modern Arabic type design, and wanted to bring that influence into the Latin character set. Typically, the Arabic letterforms for a font are designed after the Latin. I was attempting the reverse.
            br
            p After consultation with native Arabic speakers and type designers, I recognized the need to pause and revisit the Arabic letterforms after a break. However, in doing so I had already brought some of the Arabic influence into my Latin letters and hope to continue the process as time permits.
        div
            p During the semester I designed three font weights (thin, regular, bold) with three interpolated weights (extra light, light, medium), along with six specimen posters, and a twelve page newsprint typeface specimen.
            br
            p Future work includes: refined spacing, kerning pairs, sample print applications, and properly drawn weights for black and regular instead of relying on interpolation from bold to thin, and revisiting the Arabic script.
