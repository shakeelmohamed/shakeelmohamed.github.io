            p Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms to symbolize these concepts.

            p Special thanks to: River Jukes-Hudson, Cheri Gray, Shuwen Ding, and Shengjie Wu, and the great audience at Type Thursday LA for additional critique.

            p I selected a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designed a wordmark, 3' x 6' feet posters, t-shirts, name badges and restricted my color palette to black and white.
            br
            p The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contempor√°neo, has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community as a juxtaposition.
            br
            p I also designed stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.
