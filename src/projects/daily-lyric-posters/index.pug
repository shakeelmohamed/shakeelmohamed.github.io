            Of the 31 days in January, I ended up designing 24 daily posters - this was a huge win for me in terms of going through design process and sharing my results on Instagram every day. I decided to have each poster represent song lyrics that have really impacted me from my favorite artists: **24 unique artists for 24 days**
