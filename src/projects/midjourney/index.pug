            p Midjourney as a company has received tremendous amounts of press since their founding in 2021, however non-technical audiences could be discouraged using it based on their visual communication. I aimed to help them remain competitive with the rapidly growing AI landscape by making the brand more approachable.
            br
            p Special thanks to instructors Gerardo Herrera and Miles Mazzie.

            p The new Midjourney logo is an evolution of the previous sailboat symbol.
            br
            p I was inspired by the Founderâ€™s quotes, the mission statement, and light refraction as a metaphor for groundbreaking work they do within generative AI. The new brand colors are inspired by light refraction, symbolizing the expansive creativity possible with our products. These colors aim to connect with a broader audience across cultures, and industries.
            br
            p The underlying strategy is rooted in remaining competitive with the many new generative AI companies emerging since 2021.
