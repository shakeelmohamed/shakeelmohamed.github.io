        <h2>Welcome to my Labyrinth</h2>
        <p>Design, like a labyrinth, is not about rushing to the end but discovery along the way. Unlike a maze, which focuses on solving and escaping, a labyrinth invites mindful exploration. The winding path of creativity reflects the cyclical nature of design. Each project offers new ideas and insights building upon the last.<br>
