        <b>Media:</b> branding, posters, book design, augmented reality<br>
        <b>Tools:</b> InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Aero<br>
        <b>Goal:&nbsp;</b>promote a documentary about the artist.
        <br>
        <b>Recognition:</b> One poster was selected for display in office of the Chair of Graphic Design at ArtCenter.<br>
        <br>I designed a wordmark, posters, and accompanying booklet for a campaign promoting a PBS documentary about Mark Rothko, the abstract expressionist.&nbsp; My design concept was: in memoriam.

        Special thanks to: Christian Perez-Morin, Sean Adams, Michael Neal, Erin Son, Sean Shang, Brad Bartlett, and Greg Lindy  of Lux Typo. Additional thanks to the National Gallery of Art for high quality images of Rothko’s artwork, and to Architectural Digest for a beautiful photo of the Rothko Chapel.

    <div grid-col="6" grid-pad="2" class="">Depth of research and critique helped me to clarify the forms and vocabulary used throughout the project. Ultimately, I landed on a dynamic system.<br>
        <br> In my solution, “Mark” can be placed in numerous positions around “Rothko”, symbolizing the artist’s search among many styles of art. Big thanks to Erin Son for this idea during midterm guest critique!<br><br> As for the book, colors were inspired by the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. The non-denominational Chapel was one of Rothko’s final projects which he never saw completed before his passing.<br>
        <br>Intro/outro: A few spreads guide the reader from from the everyday material world to that of the mystical, symbolized by a slow gray to purple gradient. The outro follows the sequence in reverse. This concept is based on an engawa, a Japanese architecture element to bridge the outside world to the home.<br><br>Each chapter begins with a full spread. The chapter title is large, paired with a relevant Rothko quote on the opposite page.<br>

        <div class="caption">The final wordmark set on a purple inspired by the colors of Rothko’s paintings in the Rothko Chapel. The primitive forms for “Mark” tie back to the primitive emotions evoked by his work. While “Rothko” is set in all caps to symbolize the monolithic scale of his paintings.</div><br>
        <br>
        {image 8}<div class="caption">During critique with some recent alumni, Erin Son suggested looking at the placement of “Mark” as a dynamic element which could create a logo system. Conceptually, this connects back to Mark Rothko’s many years of searching before finally settling on the style of art we know him for (and his legacy) as Rothko.</div><br>
        <br>{image 12}<div class="caption">Extending the identity to a booklet required a special consideration for messaging. I chose the title “Art for Mystics”, based on the following definition for mystical: inspiring a sense of spiritual mystery, awe, and fascination. This sense of awe is due partly to the scale of Rothko’s paintings.</div>
