{image 9}<div class="caption">Audit of current brand assets. Through my interviews, I was surprised how many users of Midjourney knew little to nothing about the brand, many had no idea their logo was a sailboat. Though I explored many forms, with I chose a brand evolution rather than revolution and continued the nautical theme based on interview text with the Founder, David Holz.</div>
<br>{image 10}<div class="caption">There was little information about Midjourney’s existing brand given how new the company is. My research focused on Founder interviews to get a clear understanding of his mission.</div>

The sail is the simplest expression of the sailboat, which connects back to the above quote from David Holz.</div><br>

Attendees would be able to speak into microphones placed around the installation to generate images from their voice. During the process, I prototyped physical models at “table top” scale using Bristol paper and multiple projectors.</div><br>
