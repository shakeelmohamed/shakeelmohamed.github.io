        After my initial portfolio review at the 2021 AIGA Portfolio Festival, I recognized the need to improve my work to align with my career aspirations. One year later, at the 2022 Festival, I shared my growth journey, which ultimately led to my acceptance into ArtCenterâ€™s Graphic Design MFA program.<br>
        <br>
        Months later, at the 2022 AIGA National Design Conference in Seattle, I had the pleasure of meeting Louise and Ace, another designer whose work she reviewed during the Festival.<br>
