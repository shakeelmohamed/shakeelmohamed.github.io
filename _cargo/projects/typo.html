<b>Media:</b> branding, posters, merchandise, augmented reality, motion<br>
<b>Tools:</b> InDesign, Illustrator, Artivive, After Effects<br><br><b>Goal:</b> design an identity for a design conference, embracing the idea of a post-pandemic community building.<br><br>
<b>Typefaces:</b>&nbsp;Yink from Eclectotype and Ofelia from Blackletra.
<br>
<br>I selected a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designed a wordmark, 3' x 6' feet posters, t-shirts, name badges… and restricted my color palette to black and white.<br><br>
I also designed stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.<br>

<br>
Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms&nbsp; to symbolize these concepts.<br><br>
The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community as a juxtaposition.<br><br>
I envision conference organizers and staff wearing black shirts to not draw attention to themselves backstage. Attendees would receive white shirts when checking in on the first day of the conference. <br>

<b>Special thanks to:</b> River Jukes-Hudson, Noah Cousineau, Cheri Gray, Shuwen Ding, and Shengjie Wu, and the great audience at Type Thursday LA for additional critique.<br>
