        <b>Media:</b> branding, posters, merchandise, augmented reality, motion<br>
        <b>Tools:</b> InDesign, Illustrator, Artivive, After Effects<br><b>Goal:</b> embrace the idea of post-pandemic community building through a design conference
<br><br>
        Conferences are about the exchange of ideas and perspectives, design conferences should also be great fun. I chose this playful arrangement of curved organic letterforms&nbsp; to symbolize these concepts.<br><br>
        
        Special thanks to: River Jukes-Hudson, Cheri Gray, Shuwen Ding, and Shengjie Wu, and the great audience at Type Thursday LA for additional critique.

        I selected a list of typographers to feature for the conference, designed a wordmark, 3' x 6'&nbsp;feet posters, t-shirts, name badges and restricted my color palette to black and white.<br>
<br>
        
        The conference venue, Museo Tamayo Arte Contempor√°neo, has a sharp, brutalist architectural style. My identity design embraces the human aspect of the design community as a juxtaposition.<br><br>
        I also designed stickers and an augmented reality motion poster with a direct call to action to register for the conference.
