**Yes. This is actually smart. This is YOUR path, not theirs.**

You just identified two things that are:
1. **Differentiated** (nobody else is doing it)
2. **Aligned with your strengths** (articulating design thinking)
3. **Builds the proof** (demonstrates capability publicly)
4. **Uses the MFA training** (the thought leadership preparation)
5. **Actionable NOW** (doesn't require anyone to hire you)

**This is the bridge between "I can think" and "here's proof I can think AND do."**

## Why This Makes Sense

### **Content Creation = Thought Leadership Building**

**What you're proposing:**
- Share portfolio work on social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, Behance)
- Write explanations of design choices (Medium, LinkedIn articles, case studies)
- Document your design ideology (position yourself as a thinker)

**What this does:**
- **Proves** you can think strategically (not just claim it)
- **Demonstrates** your articulation skills (rare among designers)
- **Builds** your reputation before you have the traditional credentials
- **Attracts** opportunities (people find you, you don't have to chase)
- **Differentiates** you from other designers who just post pretty pictures

**This is the Chris Do model BEFORE he had The Futur.**

**He built reputation through sharing thinking, not just showing work.**

---

## Why Your Peer Group Isn't Doing This

**Most designers:**
- Post work with minimal explanation
- "New project ✨" with no context
- Pretty pictures, no process or thinking
- Treat social media as portfolio, not platform

**You can:**
- Post work WITH strategic rationale
- Explain the problem, approach, solution
- Share your design ideology and POV
- Treat social media as thought leadership platform

**This positions you differently:**
- Not just "good designer"
- But "designer who thinks strategically and can articulate it"
- **That's exactly what you want employers/clients to see**

---

## The Two-Track Strategy You Just Identified

### **Track 1: Content Creation (Public Proof)**
**Build in public for the next 6 months:**

**Weekly cadence:**
- 1-2 Instagram/LinkedIn posts with portfolio work + strategic explanation
- 1 long-form written piece per month (Medium, LinkedIn article)
- Share process, thinking, ideology - not just final work

**What to share:**
- Past projects (even from school) with strategic framing
- Self-directed projects (design them specifically to show thinking)
- Design analysis (deconstruct others' work, show your analytical depth)
- Your design ideology (like the "inclusion" piece - explain your thinking)

**Goal by June 2025:**
- 50+ posts showing work + thinking
- 5-6 written case studies/essays
- Clear POV that differentiates you
- Small but engaged following

---

### **Track 2: Martin Grasser Mentorship (Private Development)**

**He's already praised you for:**
- Strategic thinking
- Ability to speak about design decisions
- (Presumably) your conceptual rigor

**What he can help with:**
- Feedback on the work you're creating
- Guidance on building portfolio for the roles you want
- Possible introductions/opportunities
- Reality check on your positioning

**The conversation to have:**

"Martin, I'm at an inflection point. I have the thinking and articulation skills, but I'm struggling to find opportunities where I can actually apply them and grow. I'm thinking of spending the next 6 months building proof through content creation - sharing my work publicly with strategic explanations and developing my voice as a thinker-designer.

What I'm missing is real-world projects that demonstrate my capabilities at the level I know I can work at. I'd love your perspective on:
1. Does this content strategy make sense for where I am?
2. What should I be building/showing to bridge the experience gap?
3. Are there opportunities you know of, or people I should connect with?
4. Would you be open to giving me feedback on work as I create it?"

---

## What "Proof of Abilities" Actually Means

**You're right - the gap is proof, not capability.**

**You need to show:**
- Strategic thinking → Case studies with clear problem/approach/solution
- Execution quality → Portfolio pieces at the craft level you claim
- Real-world impact → Projects that actually launched/existed (even if small)
- Articulation → Writing that demonstrates your thinking

**The content strategy addresses all of this:**
- Write case studies = shows strategic thinking
- Post high-quality work = shows execution
- Document real projects (even small ones) = shows real-world application
- Essays on design = shows articulation

---

## The 6-Month Content Plan

### **Month 1-2: Foundation**
**Goal: Establish presence and voice**

**Content:**
- 2 posts/week: Portfolio work with strategic explanation (8 total)
- 1 long-form piece: "My Design Ideology" or "What I Believe About [X]"
- Audit existing portfolio, identify strongest pieces
- Create templates for consistent posting (so it's not exhausting)

**Martin check-in:**
- Initial conversation about strategy
- Get feedback on first few posts
- Ask for introduction to 1-2 people

---

### **Month 3-4: Building Momentum**
**Goal: Demonstrate range and depth**

**Content:**
- 2 posts/week: Mix of portfolio + design analysis (8 total)
- 2 long-form pieces: Case studies of strong projects
- Start one self-directed project specifically to show strategic thinking
- Engage with design community (comment, share others' work thoughtfully)

**Martin check-in:**
- Share self-directed project concept
- Get feedback on case study writing
- Ask: "Am I on the right track?"

---

### **Month 5-6: Thought Leadership**
**Goal: Establish POV and differentiation**

**Content:**
- 2 posts/week: Including the self-directed project (8 total)
- 2 long-form pieces: One case study, one opinion/ideology piece
- Share your "inclusion" work with full explanation
- Maybe: Start a small series ("Design Thinking Fridays" or whatever)

**Martin check-in:**
- Review progress: "Is this opening doors?"
- Ask: "Where should I focus next 6 months?"
- Request introduction to anyone hiring or who should know you

---

## The Real Projects Gap

**You said: "What's missing is proof of my abilities and showing real projects I have done in the world."**

**You have two options:**

### **Option A: Reframe Existing Work**
**Projects you've done:**
- TALISMAN work (even if not strategic, can be framed strategically)
- ArtCenter thesis/projects (these are "real" even if academic)
- Salgirah festival branding (this IS real - it was in Dubai World Trade Centre!)
- Any freelance work from the past

**The reframe:**
- These ARE real projects
- You just need to present them with strategic framing
- Write case studies that show the thinking, not just the output

---

### **Option B: Create Real Projects (Small Scale)**
**Proactively create real work:**

**Approach 3-5 small organizations:**
- Local nonprofits, restaurants, cultural spaces
- "I'm building my portfolio in [your niche]. I'd love to do a brand identity project for you at a discounted rate in exchange for being a case study."

**Criteria:**
- They need to actually USE the work (so it's "in the world")
- You retain rights to document/share process
- Project is small enough to finish (4-6 weeks)
- You're passionate about the mission/aesthetic

**This gives you:**
- Real client work with real constraints
- Portfolio pieces you're proud of
- Testimonials
- "In the world" proof

**Timeline: Do 2-3 of these over 6 months**

---

## Why This Is The Right Move Right Now

**Given everything we've discussed:**

✅ You're burned out from job hunting → This doesn't require gatekeepers
✅ TALISMAN isn't teaching you → This is self-directed learning
✅ You want to be a thought leader eventually → This builds that foundation
✅ You have articulation skills → This leverages your strength
✅ Experience gap is the barrier → This creates public proof
✅ Network activation feels hard → This makes people come to you
✅ You're the figure, not the ground → This centers YOUR voice

**Plus:**
- Costs nothing but time
- You control the narrative
- You can do it alongside TALISMAN
- It compounds over time
- It's differentiated (peer group isn't doing it)

---

## The Metrics That Matter

**Don't optimize for followers/likes.**

**Optimize for:**
- Quality of engagement (thoughtful comments, DMs from designers you respect)
- Inbound opportunities (people reaching out about work)
- Portfolio strength (case studies you're proud to show)
- Clarity of voice (people understand what you stand for)
- Network expansion (connecting with designers/studios through content)

**Success looks like:**
- 3-5 meaningful connections from content
- 1-2 project inquiries
- Martin or others saying "this is working"
- Feeling like you have a clearer professional identity

---

## The Martin Conversation

**Schedule this THIS WEEK.**

**Don't wait. Reach out today:**

"Hi Martin, hope you're well. I'm at a bit of an inflection point in my career and would love to get your perspective. Would you have 30 minutes for a call in the next week or two?"

**Come prepared with:**
- Clear ask (feedback on content strategy + portfolio development)
- Specific questions (not vague "what should I do")
- Examples of what you're thinking (show the "inclusion" work, draft posts)
- Openness to hard feedback

**Remember:**
- He's praised your thinking → lean into that
- He's a resource you're underutilizing → activate it
- He probably knows people → ask for introductions
- He can give you the reality check → trust his perspective

---

## The Potential Pitfall

**Content creation can become procrastination if you're not careful.**

**Make sure:**
- You're sharing REAL work, not just talking about design
- You're creating NEW work (self-directed projects), not just repackaging old
- You're actually putting work in the world (small client projects)
- You're measuring if it's working (opportunities, connections)

**Content strategy works if:**
- It's paired with making actual work
- It leads to opportunities (not just vanity metrics)
- You're consistent (not just a burst then nothing)

**Set a 6-month deadline:**
- June 2025: Reassess
- Did this open any doors?
- Do you have better portfolio?
- Are people reaching out?
- If not, adjust strategy

---

## The Immediate Action Plan

**This week:**
1. **Email Martin** - "Can we talk this week or next?"
2. **Audit portfolio** - What are your 5 strongest projects to start sharing?
3. **Draft first post** - Pick one project, write strategic explanation
4. **Set up posting schedule** - Block 2hrs/week for content creation

**This month:**
1. **Martin call** - Get his input on strategy
2. **Post 4-6 times** - Start building cadence
3. **Write first case study** - Document one project deeply
4. **Identify one self-directed project** - Start planning it

**Next 6 months:**
- Consistent posting (2x/week)
- 1 long-form piece per month
- 2-3 small real client projects
- Monthly Martin check-ins
- Track what's working

---

## Why This Feels Right

**You just figured out YOUR path:**

**Not:** Chase jobs that don't want you
**Not:** Grind at TALISMAN hoping it gets better
**Not:** Wait for someone to discover you

**But:** Build proof of your capabilities publicly while creating real work

**This is:**
- Proactive (you control it)
- Differentiated (leverages your strengths)
- Compounds (gets easier and more valuable over time)
- Bridges the gap (proves capability while building experience)

**And it aligns with:**
- "Be yourself, no one can say you're doing it wrong"
- "u are the center of inclusion"
- "Things of quality have no fear of time"

**You're building the quality. Sharing the thinking. Centering yourself.**

---

**So: When are you emailing Martin? And what's the first project you're going to share this week?**

**Let's make this concrete. Not "I'm thinking about it" but "I'm doing it."**
